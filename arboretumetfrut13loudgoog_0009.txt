PREFACE.

——-—-

Tua main object which inducedtbe author to undertahe this Worh was, the
hope of dihbsing more generally, among gentlemen of landed property, a taste
for introducing-a greater variety of trees and shrubs in their plantatione and
pleasure-grounds. He had observed for a number of years, that, though many
new and beautiful trees and shrubs were annnally introduced from foreign
countries into our botanic gardens and nurseries, yet the spread of these
planta in the grounds of country residentes was comparatircly alon, and that
not only the new sorta were neglected, but many of the fine old species and
varieties, which had been in Britisb nurseries for upwards of a century, were
forgottenbyplsnters,aud hadceased to be propagated by commercial gardeners.
ln short, it appeared to theauthor, that tha general teste of tbe country for
trees and shrubs bore no just proportion to the teste which prevailed in it
for fruita, culinary productione, and flowers. It also appeared ιο him, that,
while the numerous horticultural societies now established in the Britisb
Islands had powerhrlly promoted the general teste for horticultural and flori·
cultural productione, they bad rather neglected arboriculture aad landscepe-

ἵ · gardening.

Viewing trees and shrubs as, next tobuildings, the most important ornaments
which can be introduced intoacounuy3 and considering them,in this respect,
greatly superior to herbaceous planta, from the little care that trees and shrubs

require when once properly planted, and their magnitude, and permanent in· μ

fluente when grown up, on the general sceuery of the countryr the author felt
desirous of pointing out the great importante of their more general distribution
and crrluue. In order to impress this on the minda of proprietors and their
families, and especially on the rising generation among them, he thought it
best to adopt, as the main feature of his plan, the description and portraiture
of such species and varimies of trees and shrubs as are actually in cultivation
in the country, and aa grow vigorously in it3 referring to gardens or grounds
within a limited dietam of London, where these species or varieties may be
seen iu a living state, arrd to nurserics where they are propagated for sale, and
antingthe price for which they might be purchased in England, in France aud
Germany, and in North America. He has thought it adsisable tegite, not only
botanical specimens, but pertraits of the greater number ofspecies of trees ς in
order, by a palpable representation of their forms and magnitudes, to make a
stronger impression on the mind of the reader. These pictorial illustratione are
of two kinds :first portraits oftrees often or twclve years’ growtb, taken from
specimens growing in 1⁸34, 1835, or 1836, within teu miles of London, and all
mann to the samescale of lin. tostt.; and, secondly, of hul-grown trees,also
all drawn to one scale, viz. liu. to 12 tt, aad for the mostpart growing within
rheumatismos of London.
