The use ol the first class ol portraits is, togivea palpahle idea ol the general
magnitude, form, and character, which different species and varieties assume
when growing in the sarne soil and elimate, even in so short a period as ten or
twelre years after planting. A slight comparative view ol these pertraits shows
that the growth ossorne trees is much more rapid than that ol others; and that
while the species ol' sonre genera when young are comparatively monotonous
in their general form, those oi the species ol other generans the same age have
marked and characteristic features. Hence the valuable assistance afforded
by such portreits in the choice of trees sor the purposes of landscapegsrden-
ing. To solve the problem of ascertaining the species capable of producing
any desired effect of wood, or of trees, in a given locality, and in a given time,
itis only necessary to turn over the portraits which are contained in the last
sour volantes of this Work, and to select those species, the pdrtraits of which
exhibit trees ol such forms and magnitudes as will produce the effect desired.

The second class ol* portraits represents full-grown trees of the same spe·
cies as those of which portraits in their young state are givent and these, sor
the greater part, are drawn frons trees within ten miles os London, and all,
with one or two exceptions, are to one scale. The object in giving these
portraits of full-grown trees is, to show the magnitude and character which
particular species attain when they arrire at maturity, and to be a gulde to
the planter, not only in many particulare having reference to pictorial effect,
but also with respect to the uses ol troes as productiva os tirnber, shelter,
and shade.

These portraita ol trees in their young and mature state, which are contained
in the last four voluntas, together with the engraved botanical specimens, and
the scientilic and popular descriptione containedin the four volumes ol letter·
press, are calculated, as the author thinks, to create that interest in trees and
shrubs in those who have not previously paid much attention to the subject,
to produce which, as already ohserved, has been his grand object in under·
taking this work.

ln addition to the trees and shrubs which have been ten or twelve years in
the country, and which are purchasable in British nurseries, those of more
recent introduction, which are comparatively scarce, are also described or
noticed; as are some which were introduced at former periods, and havebeen

lost, indeithm which are known to botanists, but which have not yet been
intro uc .

Besides notices of new and little known hardy trees and shrubs, or of
such as are described by botanists but not yet introduced, some attention
hasbeen paid throughout the Work to trees and shrubs which, though they
will stand through the winter in mild seasons, without protection in favourable
situations, or with protection in situations and sessons less favourable, in the
climate ol' London, yet cannot be recommended sor general purpose& and
are therelorc generidly described by gardeners as only hall-hardy. These
hall-hardy species have boen noticcd, because there is perhaps no scene in
a British gardcn more interesting, than one in which the planta ol warin
