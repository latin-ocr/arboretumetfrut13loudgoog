on the part of the gardense, aad therefore eontnbute to his improvement and
consequent uaefirlness. Half-hardy trees and sbrubs of the more tendet kinds
are generally cultivated minat what is in this Work called a conservative wells
that is,a wall which may be iiaed or not according ιο circumstances, but which
admits of parting upatporary projectiug roof, or some other means of
protection, during the winter seston. Such walls are at present not very
generally in use for ornamental exotics3 but so great are the interest and
berauty which they are calculated ιο display when properly designed, planted,
and managed, that in afew years = they will probably be as generd as insit
walls; and, as ornaments to a counmy residsnce, connected with the bover-
garden and shrubbery, will be considered ss ranking next ιο the conservatory
and the green-house.

Hsving given this notice of the objecta which have led to the undertaking
of this Work, and a general outline of the plan pursued in it, the resdcr is
referred to the Introduction, and to the Explanstory Mareotes which pre·

making for several years (see the Gardener'r Megaricae, volvi, for 18³0,
p. 582. and p. 718.),was begun intinguat, laets and it has been publisbed in
Numbera, the first of which appeared in anuary, 1835, and the ead and
last on the ist of July, leae. It was originally intended ιο include in
itagcneralisation of the whole subject of the trees and slrrubs of temperate
climatoe3 bnt, finding the Work had increased to more than double the
extem originally contemplatetl, it has been thought advisable to publish the
generalisation alluded to separately3 and it will accordingly appear at some
flatura time, in one volume, under the title ofsu Escyclopoedia ojrfrboricsltars.
