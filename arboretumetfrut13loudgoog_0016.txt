EXPLANATORY REFERENCES.

Tus greater part of the letterpress of this Worlr consiste ο1 the decep,
ιίοιι, history, geography, uses, propagation, culture, dre, of the species and
varieties of the trees and shrubs cu tivated in the British lslands; sud thiais
always printed in type correspondinp in site with that used in this sentence.

The short descriptive notices ο species and varieties which it would be
desirsble to introduce, of such as have been introduced and lost, of such as
have not been seen by the author, even though mentioned iu British catalogues,
and of such as are half-hardy in the elimate ο1 London, or supposed to be so,
are uniformly printed in a smaller ty e.

The statisues‚ or accounts of re dimensione of trees, which we have
received from different parts of the British lelands or the Οοιιιίιιοιιι, are also in
small type, in order to save room.

The rtraits of trees which form the last four volumes are sometimes,
refe to as in the second volume, and sometimes as iu the last volume.
These references were made under the ides of binding up all the letterpress
in one volume, and all the platee in another, which, now that the Worlr is
linished, is found to be imprscticable. The resdiest wsy of finding the pertrait
of any particular species of tree is, ιο refer to the Alphebetical Index of
Portraits of Trees, given at the end of the eighth volume. The readiast way
of finding the description and history of any particular species or variety, end
of ascertaining whether οι· ιιοι s ligure is given of it, ss by referring to the
general Alphabetical Index, at the eud of the fourth volume.

ln various parts of the Worli reference will he found ιο Part 1V.,and ιο
the Encycbpaeds'a of Arbovindtare. These two references refer ιο one and
the saum work, viz. the E clopoediao Arboriculture which it was originally
intended to include in the rboretum amedeum, but which, for the reasons
stated in the Preface, will now be ublished separately in one volume ς and
in which the subject of trees and sileir cultius will be generalised, and their
mode ο1 treatment given en masse, whether aa seedlings in the nursery‚as
useful and ornamental plantationeas 'elding timber ssd other useful pro-
ducts, or es ornaments in the lawa an shrubbery.

Thec vings of the botanicals timens, whether printed along with the
text, or ong with the portraits o the trees in the our last voluntas, are
invariably to one and the same scale of 8 in. to 111. Where any portion of
the plant is given of the natural sine, it is distin ' hed by a cross, thus, ÷.
Where dissections are given, m. significa male,fi ale, and sang. magnifred.

The portraits of the entire trees and shrubs given along with the text are
to different scales, which are always indicated in the descriptions: they are
chiefly 1 in. to 12 ft.‚ 1 in. to 24 lt, and 1 in. to 5011.

The portraits of the trees in the last four volumea are nearly all from in·
dividuals that were growing within ten miles of London, in the years 1834,
1835, 1836, οι· 1837. These portraits are chiefly ο1 young trees, often or
twelveyeers’growth,andered1awn to a scale of lm. to sle: but there
are also portreits ο1 full-grown trees, of all the principal kinds of which
full· own specimens are ιο be found within ten miles of London(talren
ehie yfronr Syon), and these are drawn to ascale of l in. ιο tet.

Of some s ecies of trees good full-grown examples could not be found
within tenni-es of Lond0n; and of these portraits heve been takep from
