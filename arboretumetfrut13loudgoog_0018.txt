The sign ..J (ort-l. indicating amenter degree of tenderneaa), added to any
ot' the abore s' s in theTable ol Contenta, indicates thartha trae or shnrb, in
the climate of ondon, requires protection during winter, but ia considered
likel to live against a conservative wall. Throu hout the Work, wherever
the dimensione ofany tree or shrubare given, and tlte year when these dimen-
sions were taken is not stated, the autumn of the year 1834, when the Work
was commenced, is to be understood.

ml the botanic names throughout the Work are accented, and have their
origin indicated, aa in the Hortus amanum and the Gardener’r Megarice.
The vowels which are sounded short are marked withan acute arcent, thus
(‘), as A'ceras; and those which arc sounded long are marked with agrave
accent, thus (⁸),as Altum. The origin of each name rs indicated thus: where the
name has been applied to a plaut by the audente, the first letter is in Italic,
aa Pinua3 where rt ia commemorative of some individual, the letters ad-
ditional to the name are in Italic, as Bdnksr'a, lambertidno, Dougldsr's';
and where an aboriginal name has been ado ted, or where the name is of
uncertain derivatico, tlte whole word is in llalic aa, Aildntus, Carngdno, dre.

When the came would otherwise beia Italic, aa in the case of s non es,
headinya to aragraphr, dcc, these distinctions are of course reversed, aa dhar,
Bdnlna, 'antua All the other acientffic names,generic or specihc, are com-
posed from the Greek or Latm, wrth the exceptton of a very few, which are
taken from places: aa Arauedria, from the country oi the Araucanians ; Quercus
