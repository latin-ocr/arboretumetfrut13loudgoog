Every one feels that trees are among the grandest and most
ornamental objects of natural scenery: what would landscapes
be without thern? Where would be the charm of hills, plains,
valleys, rocks, rivers, cascades, lakes, or islands, without the
hanging wood‚ the widely extended forest, the open grove, the
scattered groups, the varied clothing, the shade and intricacy,
the contrast, and the variety of form and colour, conferred by
trees and shrubs? A tree is a grand objectio itself; its bold
perpendicular elevation, and its commanding attitude, render it
sublime3 and this expression is greatly heightenedb ourlmow·

beauties of the general orms of trees arc as various as their

different seasons of the year, alone form a source of ever-varying

of the buds of trees in sprin ‚ or the daily changes which take
place iu the colour of their foliage in autumn?- But to point
out here all the various and characteristic beauties of trees, would

different species and varieties enumerated in our Worlr.

Shrubs, to many of the beauties of trees, frequently add those
of herbaceous plants3 and produce flowers, unequalled both for
beauty and fragrance. What flower, for example, is compa·
rable in beauty of form and colour, in fragrauce, and in inte·
resting associations, with the rose? The flower of the honey·
suchle has been admired from the most remote antiquit, and
forms as frequent an ornament of classic, as the rose oes of
Gothic, architecture. In British gardent, what could compensate
us, in winter, for the arbutus and the laurustinus, or even the
comrnon laurel and the common ivy, as ornamental evergreens ;
for the flowers of the rhododendron, azalea, kalmia, and
mezereon, in spring; or for the fruit of the gooseberry, currant,
and raspberry, in summer? And what hedge plant, either in
Europe or America, equals the common hawthoml In short,
