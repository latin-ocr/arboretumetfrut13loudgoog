INTRODUGHON· 3

11 trees may be compared to the colurnus which support the
portico of a temple, shrubs may be considered as tha statues
which surmount its pediment aud as the sculpturas which orna·
ment its frieze.

It is not to be wondered at, that trees and shrubs should have
excited the attention 01 mankind iu all civilised countries, and
that our accumulated experience respectiug thern should be con-
siderable. The first characteristic instinct of civilised society is,
to improve the natural productione by which we are surrounded 3
and the next is, by commarca to appropriate and establish in our
own country the productioris of others, while we ‘ve our own
productioris in erchange3 and, thus, the tendency o all improve-
ment seems to be to the equalisation of enjcyment, as wellas to
its increase.

Notwithstanding the use, the grandem, and the beauty of
timber trees, it is a fact, that, compared with herbaceous vege-
tsbles, the number 01 species distributed over the globe is com·
parativelysmall. The palms, the banana, the plne-appla, aud
other planta, popularly or botanically considered as trees or
shrubs, though some of thern attain agreat height and thickness,
are, with very few exceptione, of no use as timber. Almost all
the timber trees cf the world, with the exception of the bamboo,
belong to what botanists denominate the dicotyledonous division
of ve etables3 and, perhaps, there are not a thousand genera of
this division on the face of the earth which afford timber· trees
axceeding 3011.ἱο height. The greater part 01 these genera,
11111111110011111111111111 111111ἓὲ
rendered temperate by their elevation, the number of genera
containing timber trees 30 st. in height, as far as hitherto dis-
covered, does not amount to a hundred. The truth is, that
between the tropice the greater number of species arc ligueous,
while in the temperate regions there are comparativcly few, and
in the frozen zone scarcely any. lt may naturally be expected,
therefore, that, in the temperate regions, there should only be a
few timber trees which are indigeuous to each particular country.
In Britain, for example, there are not above a dozen genera of
treas, furnishiug in all about thirty species, which attain a height Α
exceedin 80 ft ; but there are other countries of similar climates,
all over the world, which furuish other genera and species, to
what is, at present, an unknown extent3 and it is the beautiful
work 01 civilisation, of patriotism, and of adventure, first, 10001-
lect these all into our own country, aud next, to distribute them
into others. While Britain, therefore, not only enjoys the trees
of the rest of Europe, of North America, of the mountains of
South America, of India, and 01 China, she distributas her own
trees, and those which she has appropriated, to each 01 these
