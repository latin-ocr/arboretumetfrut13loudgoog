thus contributing almost imperceptibly, but yet most powerfully,
to the progress and equalisation of civilisation and of happiness.
lt must be interesting to the philosopher and the philanthro-
pist, to know the precise position in which we stand relatively
to this kind of interchange of natural productions. Much as bas
been done within the last century, there is reason ιο believe,
from the number of countries unexplorad‚ that this department
of the civilisation of the great human family is yet in its infancy.
Hence, in a work like the present, which professes to be a

a generad view cf all other countries with reference to those trees
which they contain which have been already introduced, or
which, though we do not yet possess, we may expect to obtain
and establish. This, there ore, will form Pras 1. of our Work;
and we trust it will be found cf considerable interest, by direct·
ing the attention of botanical collectore, travellers, and persons
resident abroad, to specillo objecta of research.

In carrying this intention into effect, we shall commeuoe by
taking ageneral view of the trees and shrubs which were known
to the ancients3 we shall nent ive an enumeration of those
which are iudigenous ιο the Britisi lslauds3 aller which we shall
treet of the introduction of foreign trees and shrubs into Britain,
from the earliest recorda up to the end of the year laet, the
period at which this Work was commenced.

Havin thus discusaed the history of the trees and shrubs,
native and foreign of the British lalanda, we shall next give a
similar view of the indigenous and introduced trees and shrubs
of all those other countries which possess, either by geo aphy
or altitude, climates in any degree analogous to that of iliata.
This part of the Work will be concluded by a chapter on the
literature of the trees and shrubs of temperate climates; in
which the principal works which bave appeared on the subject,
both in Europe and America, will be enumerated.

The next division of our Work, Panr ΙΙ., will be devoted to
the science of the study of trees. ln this part, trees will be
considered in all their various relations to natureand art. They
will be considered as component parts of the eneral scenery of
accuntry3 in regard to the expression and character of parti·
colar kinds; in regard to the mode of delineating thern pictorially,
and of describing them populnrly and botanically. They will
also be considered with reference to uncultivated nature, to cul-
tivated nature, and to man. This part will conclude with a sunr-
cwwwwrrn struve
shrubs, which are to follow as the third partos this Work.
