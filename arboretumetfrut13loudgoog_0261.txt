Phar 111, which will form our next division, and that, indeed,
which will compriee hy far the greater part of the Worlc, will be
tha history and description of the different species and vari-
etiee of trees and shrubs, whether native or indigenous, useful
or ornamental, at present cultivated in Britain.

We shall add to the perfectly hardy species the names, ancl
short descriptive paragraphs, of some ligneous plants, which have
been found by cultivators to be half-hardy in the climate ofLon·
don3 and of others, which, from their native countries and habits,
we think not unlilreiy to prove so. We make this addition to
the Arcam et Fruticrtum Britannicam for two purposesr
in the first place, because, by trying species from all countries in
the open air, some hitherto kept in hot-houses or green-honses
may be found quite bardy3 such barin been the case with
Kerria japonica, Cydonia japonica, ydrdngea Hortensia,
Anaua japbnica, and a number of others. We may add, also,
that, though the nature of a species cannot be so far altered as

· to titan inhabitant of a very hot climate for a cold oue, yet that

the habits of individuale admit of considerable variatim, and
that some plante of warm climates are found to adapt them·
salves much more readily to cold elimatos than others. Thus,
the common passion dower, accord' to Dr. Wallrer, when
first introduced into the Edinburgh tanic Garden, lost its
leaves during winterr but, in the course ofafew years, thesaure
plant retained the greater part of them at that season. The
same author relatee that plants of the common yew, sent from
Paris to Stockholm to plant certain designs by Le thre, laid
out there for the lring of vaeden, all died, though the yewis
a native of the latter country, as well as of France. ’

Every gardenm must have observed that the common weeds
rrhich have sprung up in pots, in hot-bede or in hot-housea, when
these pots hoppen to be set out in the open air during winter or
spring are killed, or have their leaves injured3 whilst the sama
species, which have sprung up in the open ground, arc growing
around thamin a flourishing condition. .

The obvious conclusione from these facts are, that the habits
of planta admit of a certain degree of change with regard tn the
climate which they will bear ; that the degree in which thispower
:tthhtthttht tth2tr¹gtt⁶ttthhttttt¹tttr
in tha open air plante usually lrept under gloss. There is reason
to believe, from trials alrmdy made, that man of the trees and
ahrubs of Australis, and particularly those of ew Zealand and
Van Diemen's Lsnd, will ultimately become so habituated to the
climate of London, asto live through the winter against a wall,

with scarcely any protection. , Β 4
