6 IMRODUGHON·

The second reason why we have included a number of half-
hardy, or supposed half-hardy, trees and shrubs in this Work is,
that we think there are few scenes in en ornamental garden ·
or plessero-ground of reater interest to a person having any
knowledge of botany, however slight, than a conservative wall;
thetis, a wall covered with trees and shrubs, natives of foreign
climates, which, though they may be killed rothe ground during
winter, yet exhibit a degree of luxuriance during the summer
season, which they never can display in our green-houset or
conservatories. Even were all such plants to be killed by frost
every winter, and a reserve obliged to be kept in green-houses
or pits to supply their place every spring, still, the splendour of
their appearance during the summer months, and the novelty of
their forms when compared with those of the spring, usually
grownjn the open air in Britain, would far more than compen·

sate fo'r thc trouble incurred. When we take into consideration ·

how easy it is to have such walls duod, aud to heat the borders

in front of them by small pipes of hot water, the capacities of a ⁸

conservative wall and horder appear great beyond anything we
can at present calculate ους and we are persuaded that, were the
subject of conservative walls warmly taken up by a spirioed and
wealthy individual, something would be produced in this way,
as superior to our present green-houses and conservatories, as
these are to dre oran ries and green-heusen of the time of
Evelyn, or even of Mi er. Having thus given our reasons for
the introduction of half-hardy species of trees and shruhs into
this Work, we shall next submit a few· words with respect to our
arrangement and treatment of the hardy species.

The general arrangement of the Ardoretmn et Furiosum
Britannicum will be that of the natural system3 by which,
whether in botany, aoology, or mineralogy, those objects are
brought together which resemble one another in the estest
number of particulare. ln describing each species, we s all fol-
low the summary of particulare laid down in the last chapter of
Part II.; giving in succession the identification of the name by
botanists; the synonymes, botanical andvernacular3 references
to publiahed engravings3 the specific character3 the popular
description3 the geography; the history3 the poetical and le·
gendary allusions3 the properties arrd uses3 the soil and situ-
ation; the propagation and culture; the accidente and diseases
which the plant is liable τος the insecta and parasitic plants which
inhabit it; examples of its growth in the British Islands and
on the Continent3 and, lastly, its price in some of the principal
British, Continental, and American nurseries.

ln identifying the name of every species, or variety, with that
given to it by botanical writers, we have been guided principally
by our own examination ol the living plant, and comparing it
