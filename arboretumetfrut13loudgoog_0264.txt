there are a great many names of species enumerated in botanical
works‚ our own Hortus Britannias not excepted, as having been
introduced into this country, which are not ιο he found in any

already in the country, reintroduoed under new names. In
either case, according to the present mode of compiling botanical
catalogues, the introduction of these names in'such catalogues
(provided the authorities are given with them) is nnnvoidable,
whether the things tc which they epply are in existence or not.
It is easy to conceive some of the evils which, in a practical point
of view, result from this mode of making catalogues; but itis
necessary to be at once a practical bomnin aud a practical
gardener, to comprehend the whole of them. One evilis, that,
when collectore of trees, for example, order the planta bearing
these names from the nurserymeu, they either do not receive
any planta at all, cr they receive something which they do not
want, and, probably, something which they already have.
Another evil is, that nurserymeu, in order to supply the demand
for novelties, οι· ιο establish or keep up the appearance cf
havingan extensive collection, too frequently introduce names
into their catalogues for which they cannot supply plants3 cr
they introduce synonymes without indicating that they are such.
The effect of this is, that gentlemen intending to form collec-
tions, finding their intentione frustratcd, frequently give up the
pursuit in disgust.

· Imperfect as are the collectione, and erroneous as ia the no·
menolature in public nurseries, it will readily be conceived how
difficult it is fora practical gardener to acquire a tolerahle know·
led eof the trees and shrubs actually in the counuy3 and it ia
evident that, without this knowledge on his part, it is not to be
expected that any but the most common trees and shrubs can be
recommended by him to his employers: indeed, no British

iu the Kew Garden, in the garden of the Horticultural societ ,
in that ofMessrs. Loddiges, in the Botanic Garden at Edinburgl,
or in some other garden which contains an arboretum, can be
said ιο know the names of one fourth of the trees and shrubs
already in the country. The Arboretum et blattarum Britan·
cicun, uve think, will go far· to remedy this evil, by enabling both
gardeners and their employers to ascertain, not only what trees
are in the country, but where they may see them growin
