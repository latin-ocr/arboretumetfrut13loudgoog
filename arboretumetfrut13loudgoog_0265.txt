have an opportunity of correctly ascertaining the names of such
as they already possess, hut oi supplying themselves with cuttings
or planta of such sorts as they may not ave incultivation. The
purchasers oi trees, hy elwa s using the nomenclatura of the
Arboreae Britannicum, and heing ahle to refer from it to the
living specimeus from which our engravings were taken, will at
onoc insure certainty as to the kinds they obtain, and stimulate
the nurserymen to accuracy, in regard to the names of those
plants which they possess and propagate, and to the cultivation
of a greater number of species and varieties. After the pub·
lication of our Worlr, it will he the fault oi the nurseryman
alone, if his nursery do not contain plante of all the species and
varieties which we have figured and described.

Many persons, when recommended to plant, reply: ‘⁶ of what
use is it to plant at my age? 1 ean never hope to live to see
· my plants become' trees.” This sort oi answer does not, at first
{tlttttffttt't‘tltlt‘sb‘t‘tltttttl‘ttttttl
men of thirty or forty. In either case, such an answer is the
resultus avulgar error, founded on mistahen and prejudiced '
notione. We shall prove its incorreotness by matters of fact.

In the year 1830, there were many sorts of trees in the orbo-
retum of Messrs. Loddiges which ad bech planted exsctly ten

years, and each of which exceeded 8011. in height. Most of
these trees have since been cut down ior want of room3 but we
have the names and the measurement of the whole of them.
There are, also, at the present time (December, 1831), many
trees iu tho arboretum of the London Horticultursl Society's
(iarden at Chiswiclt, which have been only ten years planted,
and which are between 8011. and 40 st in height. Why, then,
should any one, even of seventy years of age, assign as a reason
sor declining planting, that he cannot hope to live to see his
planta become trees? A tree 80st. high, practically speaking,
will effect all the general purposes for which trees are planted:
it will afford shelter and ahade3 display individual beauty aud
character ; aud confer expression on landscape scenery.

There is oue subject which we shall occasionally touch on, in
the history oi particular species, and also in taking a general
viewof the trees of each genus, or of each natural order; and
that is, the improvement which many species are probably sus·
ceptible of hy crosa-fecundation with other species nearly allied to
them, or by procuring new varieties through the selection of re-
markable individuals from seedlings raised in the common way.
We shall also hear in mind the manner in which curicus varieties
are procured hythe selection oi shoots which present those
anomalous appearances which gardeners call sporta, and which,
when propagated by grafting, continue to preserve their pecu·
liarities. It should never he forgotten by cultivators, that all
