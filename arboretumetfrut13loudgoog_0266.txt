our most valuable plante, whether in agriculture, horticnltura,
or floriculture, are more or less indebted for their excellence
to art. Our cultivated fruit trees are very different from the
same trees iu a wild state ς and our gardan and field herbaceous'
vegetables so much so, that, in many instances, not even a

botanist could recognise the wild and the cultivated plant to be
the same species. there is reason to believe that the same
means by which we have procured our improved varieties ol
fruit trees will be equally effective in producing improved varie·
ties ol timber trees. A lew species, such as the oalr, tbe elm,
tbe magnalia, δια, have had improved varieties raised from seed
by accidental crossing, or by the selection of individuale from
multitudes ol seedlings3 and variegated varieties, and varieties
with anomalously formed leaves, or with droopin orerectshoots,
heve been procured from the sports ol parts oldifferent plante.
But the mode ol improvement by creas-fecundation is yet quite
in its infancy with respect to timber trees; and to set limite to
the extent and beauty of the new varieties which may be pro-
duced by it is impossible. 'lbere is no reason why we may not
have a purple-leaved oak, or elm, or aab, as well as a purple·
leaved beech3 or a droopin sweet chestnutas well as a drooping
ash. The oalt is 8 tree that varies astonishingly by culture ς
and, when the numerous American varieties that have been
introduced into this country shall have once begun to bear seed,
there is no end to the fine hybrida that may be originated be
tween tbem end the European species. In short, we see no
difficulty in improving our ornamental trees and sbrubs to as

Pater IV, which will form the last division of the Arboreus
ct Fmticetnm Britannicam, will be devoted to selected lists of the
trees and shrubs described, classilied according to tbeir different
capacities sor sulfilling the various purposes lor which trees and
shrubs are required by the plantet and by the landaoape-gar·
dener. For the rest we refer to the Table of Contents. ἱ

The utility of such a Worlt as the Arboretwm et Fndicatwm
Britannicam to the gardening world, and to the lauded pro-
prietor, will not, we think, be questioned. We shall say nothing,
therefore, of the influence which it cannot fail to have in pro·
moting a teste for the culture and spread of such foreign trees
as we have already in the country; and in exciting a desire for
introducing others from different parts of the world, and sor
originating new varieties by the different means employed by
art sor that purpose. One remark, however, we may be per-
mitted to make on the use of such a Worlt ns the Arboretum et
dimicatum Britannicam to gentlemen of landed property. Every
