from this Work to combine beauty with utility, by planting‚ in
the outer margins of his natural woods or artificial plantations,
and along the open rides lathem, and in the hedgerows of his
lanes and public reads, trees which are at once highly ornamental
8ηά more or less useful-in some cases, perhaps, even more,
useful - than the common indigenous trees for which they are
substituted. If, on the other band, his estate is already fully
planted, he will leam from this Work bow he may beautify his
plantations by a mode which never yet has been applied in a
general way to forest trees3 ria, by heading down large trees
of the common species, and grafting on them foreign species of
the sarne genus. This is acommcn practice in orcbards of fruit
trees; and why it should not be so in parlrs 8ηά pleasure-grounds,
along the margins of woods, and in the trees of hed rows, no‘
other reason can be assigned than that it has not hit erto been
generally thought of. Hawthorn hedges are common every·
where3 8ηά there are between twenty and thirty beautifril species
8ηά varieties of thorn in our nurseries, which might be grafted
on thern. Why should not proprietors of wealth and taste desire
their gardeners to graii some of the rare and beautiful sorta of
tree thornson the common hawthorn bushes, at intervals, so as κ
to form standard trees, in such of their hedges as berder public
reads? And why should not the scarlet oak 8ηά the scarlet
acer be grafted on the common species of these genera, along
the margins of woods 8ηά plantationsi Such improvements the
more stron ly recommend themselves, because, to many, they
would involve no extra expense; and, in every case, the effect
would be almost immediate. Every gardener can graft and bud3
and every landed proprietcr can procura stock plants from nur·
series, frorn which he can take the graiis3 or be nray get scions
from botanic gardens, the garden of the London Horticnltural
Society, that of the Caledonian Horticnltural Society, or the
Dublin Garden at Glasnevin.

Amateur landscapegardeners, and architects who lay out the
grounds of the houses they have designed, will be enabled,b
this Work‚ to choose the kinds of trees which they think will
produce the best effect in their plantations3 and, what is of much
more consequence, which will produce 8 certain effect within a
given number of years. Indeed, tlre want of such aWork as the
Arboremm et miceam Britannicam to professional landscape-
gardeners, and a conviction of the great use it would be of to
practicel gardeners, and to all persons engaged in laying out
grounds, or in forming ornamentel plantatione, first suggested
to us the idea of commencing the Work.

In modern landscape-gardening, considered as a fine art, all
