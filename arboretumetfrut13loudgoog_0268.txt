avowed. This is the case 111 the fine arts: there rs no attempt

10 conceal art in music, poetry, pointing, or sculpture3 none in

modern landscape-gardeningi Because, we shall be told, itis
an ert which imitates nature. But, does not lendsenpepainting
also imitate nature3 and yet, in 11, the work produced isac-
knowledged to be one 01 art? Before this point is settled, it is

In what are called the imitatire arts, it will be found that the
imitation isalways made in such a manneras to produces totally
distinct work from the thing imitated3 and never, on any 00-
count, 10 like as to be mistaken for ir. ln landscape-painting,
scenery is represented by eolours on 0 flat surface3 in sculpture,
- forms, which in nature are coloured, are represented in colour-
less stone. The intention of the 011111, in both 00101, is not to

must be adopted by the landscapegardener. In the geometrical

style, he has succeeded perfectly, by arranging grounds and
