infuncy. An English landowner is almost always a great re·
specter of trees generally, but seldom knows anything of par·
ticuler sorta: he, therefore, cares very little for their individual
beauties, and contente himself with being an indiscriminate
admirer of them. Hence the unwillingness of most persons to
cut down trees, however improperly they may be placed3 orto
thin out plantatione, however much they may be crowded, and
however great moy be the injury which the finer foreign sorte
are sustaining from the merser-growing indigenous kinds. 'Ibis
indiscriminate regard for trees, and morbid feeling with reference
to cutting them down when they arc wrongly placed or too
thick, principolly results from ignorance of the kinds and of the
relative beauty of the different species, end horn want of teste in
landscape-gsrdening. When we consider that it is not much
above a century since American trees began to be purchasable
in the nurseries of this country, this is not to be wondered at;
aud, more especially, when it is remembered that planters,
generally speaking, have few opportunities of seeing specimens
of these trees, so as to become acquainted with them, and thus
to acquire a tacte for this kind of beauty and its pursuit. The

To artico, the Arboretum et Farrticetum Bn'tuanicraa will not
be without its use. It is well known thst there are but few
laudscape-painters who possess that kind of knowledge of trees
which ls necessary to enable them to produce such portraits as
would indicate the kind to a gardener or a forestes. This
defect, on the part of landscapepainters, arises partly from their
