Tabas ΛΝΒ SHRUBs OF ramaneant chimeras.

Tua use of the slight general outline which we propoae now
submitting to the reader is, partly, to show the consideration
in which trees have been held in all eges and countries; but
principally to record what has been done in the introduction of

. foreign trees into¹ Brit'aiu3 and to point out, frorn the ligneous

productione of other oountries having similar climates, what
remains to be. accomplished. We shall first notice to what
extent a love for, and e knowledge of, trees existed among the
natione os antiquity; and, next, give a general idea of the indi-
genous and introduced trees of those countries occupied by the
modern nations of Europe. We shall commence with Britain;

and shall take, in succession, France, Germany, and the other ι

Europeau oountries. Afterwards, we shall ive a slight sketch
of the trees suited to temperate climates which are nativas of
Asia, Africa, America, and Australia.

Tua first notices which we have of trees are in the Sacred
Writinga. The tree of knowledge, and the circumstance of our
first parents hiding themselves among the trees of the rden of
Edon, are ,familiar to every one. Soomon appears to ave col·
lected all kinds of planta, and not only to have had au orchard
of fruit trees, and trees bearing apices, bnt to have included iu
his grounds what are called barren trees, and among these the
cedar. As this trecis a native of a cold and mountalnous

’ country at some distance from Judea, it shows that the practice

of collecting trees from a distance, and from a different climate,
to assemble them in one plantation or arboretum, is of tha
earliest date. The cedar, indeed, is frequently mentioned in
Scripturc; and both that and the fir (including, under tbis
name, probably both Pinus and Abies, for some species of both
are nativet of Asia Minor and Graece) are said, in the book of

Eaekiel‚ to be frequent in magnificent gardens. Large trees
were then used as places sor meeting under (aa they are, in the

East, tp this day); and they were then, as now, planted in
cemeterres
