Trees are mentioned in the writings of Hesiod and Homer.
The gardan of Alcinous is said to have contained various sorts
os lruit trees: and directions are given in Hesiod forlopping the
poplar, and other species, sor fuel; and felling the oak, the elm,
and other kinds of large trees, for timber.

The principal trees of the Egyptians, according to Herodotus,
were, the palm, the sycamore fig, the lote tree (Celtis australis,
according to Mr. Hogg, Garri. Mag, x. asta, the olive, and
,the pomcgranate. There are, we know, several other trees which
are natives of Egypt; but these were probably thought most
worthy of being recorded, as producing edible fruit. ’

The gardens of the Persicas contained trees; and those in
the gardan of the younger Cyrus, at Sardis, were all planted with
his own hand, in straight lines: the only mode which, at that
early period, when scarcely any but indigeuous trees v'vere in use'
by planters, could convey the expression of art and design. In

. general, the trees which most attracted the attention of the

ancients were those which bore edible fruita, produced spicea,
¹had a terebinthina odour, or possessed spreading branches to
afford shade. Hence the frequent mention of tlte palm, the fig,
the olive, the cinnamon, the camphor, the cypress, the sycomora
fig, and the plane.
The only positive source of information respecting the trees
known to the nations of antiquity, down to the time of the Gracia,
. is to be iound in the works of Theophrastus. Stackhouse, in his
edition of Theophrastus’s Historia Plantcmm, has endeavoured
to show the modern botanical names for the plants of which
Theophrastus has treated. Sprengel bad done the same thing
in his Historia loz· Herbarioe. Stackh'ouse has added. to his
own indentifications as many of those of Spren el as are dif-
ferent from, and supplementary to, his own. Troia both we
bave selected the following list of the ligneous species. Stack-
house has stated in the presace to his second volurne (bis work
is in two volumes, 1813, 1814), that Sprengel has carefully
ascertained 857 of the kinds treated of by Theophrastus, and
that he has passed over the rest, which are nearly as many in
number, in silence3 except remarking the circumstances which
make them so ambiguous as to render the identilying of them
hopeless. To some ol the identifications which have been
proposed, doubt appertains3 and, in tlre case of the ligneous '
species, in the enumeration below, this doubt is expressed by
notes of interrogation. It may be observari, that the greater
number of these plants, according to Sibthorp's Flora Graeca,
are nativas of Graece, and that most of those which are not,
will endur'e the open air, or are cultivated, in that country. The
whola'of them, with.scarcely any exceptione, are in British
gardens and hot-houses3 and all those which we have marked
