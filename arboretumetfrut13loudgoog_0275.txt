The Rorauns appear to have hegun with a knowled e of ell
the trees possessed ‘by the Greeks3 and there are addefto them,
in their works, almost all the trees of the colder regions of Eu·

from other countries3 because frequent mention is made, by
their icultural writers, of the platanus, the cedar, the cypress,
and o er trees, which are not indigenous to Italy3 and the
