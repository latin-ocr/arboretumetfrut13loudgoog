Now ln THE BRITISH Istasos.

Tus trees and shrubs now indigenous to, or cultivated in, the
British Islands, including Ireland, the Channel lslands, and the
other adjacent isles, naturally form two divisions3 viz, those
'which are ol spontaneous growth, and those which have been
introduced or originated hythe art and industry of man. In
order to convey distinct ideas respecting the number and nature
ol the native woody plants which may be considered as abori-
ginal and permanent inhabitants ol this country, we shall give
an enumeration of them, arranged according to the natural
orders to which they belong3 and, iu order to show the progress
of the introduction of foreign species, the number introduced,
and the individuale to whom we are indebted for such intro-

ductions, we shall treat of the native and foreign plants
separately.

Tnn native planta of any island may generally be considered
as the same as those of the continent to which that island belongs;
and hence we find that there are very few trees and shrubs which
are indigenous to the north of Franee, Belgium, and the north
ol Germany, which are not also natives of Britain. In countries'
which have been long civilised, it appears difficult to determine
what trees or plants are aboriginal,andwl1at have been intro·
duced ς anderen in wild countries, the same difficulties may be
said to occur, since the seeds of the plants of one country may

be, and undoubtedly are, carried to another country by birds and
other animals, and may spring up there, mature themselves, and
continue their species lilre aboriginal plants. lt is probable that
this process has gone on mereor less in every country frdn its
