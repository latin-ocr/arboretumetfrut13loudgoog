independently of human art, is to equalisc the productione of
similar climates.

Caesar, in his conmentario, states that he found the woods of
Britain to contain the same trees as those of Gaul, with the ex·

given rise to much coutrb‘hersy, some authors supilosirlg that
Caesar, by the word abietem, meant the wild or Scotch pine,
which is a native of Britain. As, however, the Romans de·
signated the silver fir abies, there can be little doubt that this
was tha tree alluded to by Caesam which not onl does not grow .
wild in England, but was not introduced into this country till
modern times. This solution of the passage is so simple, that
it is difficolt to imagine how any mistake can have arisen, par·
ticularly as Pliny speaks of the Scotch pine expressly as P1uus
sylvestris (Not. Hist, lib. xv. 'and xvi.) The only reason appears
to he, that the Scotch pine was formerly called the Scotch fir3
and that the word abies, being considered to signify fir, was,
without further examinatior, supposed to apply to that tree.

lt is more difficult to recoucile Coesar's assertion thot he did
not find the fagus in Britain, as that name is generally supposed
to have been applied by the Romans to the common beech.
Belou informs us that, iu his time (Les Oba, dc, en Grdce, err
Asia, et autres Pays drangas, 1554), on Mount Athos aud in
Macedonia, the beech was called phe It is wonderful, there·
fore, says Ray, that Caesar should eny the beech to BritaIn:
his doing so can only be satisfactorily accounted for, by sup·

the pilragm of Theophrastus. Mr. Long, in his observatione
on certain Rornon Bonus, aad Tomns, in tle Sotdlr (ff Britain,
p. 86„ asserts that the tree Caesar called fagus was the sweet
chestnut, F ³ us Castanea I.. Mr. Long does not state his
grounds scrutinis opiniou; but should the fagus of the Romans
be our chestnut, and their castanea our beech, it would not
only explain this difficulty, but do much to reconcile that

that canbe conclude from his remark is, that the beech was
not, in his time, discoverable in large masses in Kent3 where,
though it grows naturally, it is only found on the hills and not in
the plains. Mr. Whitaker‚ in his History of Manchester, con·

assertion of Caesar above alluded to, and partly from the name
for the beech in the British language, foighe‚ faghe, faydh,
