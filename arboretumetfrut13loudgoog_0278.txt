Saron is bece3 bache, Fr.; and buche, Ger. The Scotch pine,
Whitalrer thinks, was a native of the island before the arrival oI
the Romans, though unknown to them at their invasion ; and this
pina, judging from the resinous quality ol that dug up from peat
bogs, he considers to have been osa different species from that
now own in England, and “the same assuredly with the
Srotc fir of the highlauds of Scotland.” Here we know the
author to be entirely mistaken ; the species being every where the
same, and the quality of tha timberdiffering only in consequence

’ of differences in the soil and situation. sir Walter Scott fell

into a similar error, when he stated, in the Qrtarterty Reoieta
(xxxvi. 580.), thatour ‘⁶ Scotch fir was brought srom Canada, not
more than half a century ago,'’ and that the true species, sound
in the north of Scotland in immense forests, grows with “huga
contorted arms, not altogether unlilre the oak.” The conjec-
tures of these two eminent writers only show that, however
great may be their authority in other matters, they are not to be
depended upon in what ooncerns trees. The Scotch pine must,
unquestionably, have been indigenous in the highlands ol Scot-
land in the time of Coesar, though, in all probability, not to be
met with, or rare, in England, at least in the southern counties.

The Romans, Whitaker observes, first brought among us,
as their present names sufficiently show, “the platanus or plane,
the tilia or teil, the buxus or box, the ulmus or elur, and the

of Avellonia, or the appla orchard, previously to the arrival of
the Romans. Before the third century, this fruit had spread ·
over the whole island, and so widely, that, according to Solinus,
there were large plantatione of itin the “ Ultima Tuder The
Romans added “the pear, the damson, aud the cherry, the
arbor persica, perch, or peach3 aprica, or apricot3 and cydonia,
or quince.” Cherries were introduced from Pontus and Egypt
into Italy by Lucullus, who conquered the former country; and
they were carried into Britain within five years of the first set·
tlemant of the Romans in the country. Pears ubounded in
Italy, though it is uncertain at what time the Romans brought

them into England. The damson was originally brought from
Damascus to Italy, and thence to BritaIn, as the quince was from
Crete, and the peach from Persiat the latter was common in
Gaul In the time of Agricola.

The mulberry, the chestnut, the fig, and the sorbus, or true
service, were introduced by the Romans. lt is singular, that,
