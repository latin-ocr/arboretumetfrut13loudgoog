in worcestershire, the remains of a Roman villa were some
years discovered (see Arci. Mag„ 11. p. 94.). It is 11311111-
probabe that the 1133 referred to may be a descendant from a
service trae planted in the orchard belongin to the adjoining
Roman villa. The chestnut belongs to Sarllis in Asia Minor3
and it was brought thence to Tarentum and Napl'es, where
it was cultivated with great success in the reign of Vespasian.
That the chestnut was in Britain 33 early as the rath century is
placed beyond dispute by Giraldus Cambrensis, who, in speak-
ing of the trees of Britain which lreland wants, mentions the
chestnut and the beech. Daines Barringon conjectures that
the chestnut was probably brought into ngland from Spain;
and Dr. Ducarel, who had a dispute with Barrington on
the subject (see Phil. Trana, lix. and lxi), endeavours to
prove that it is a native. Mr. Whitaker thinks, and, in our

from ltaly by the Romans, the hest being those of Praenestina
and Campania. The rosemary and the thyme are also supposed
to have been introduced by the Romans. The thyme, in the
days of Vespasian, Pliny observes (11111.]0.),3ο greatly over-

spresd the ¹plains in the province of Narbonne, that many

thousands o cattle were brought every year from the distent

Applying these 13313 1ο what are commonly considered native

the yew, which, he says, is seldom found but in churcbyards or
in artificial plantations. He also doubts the spindle tree and
