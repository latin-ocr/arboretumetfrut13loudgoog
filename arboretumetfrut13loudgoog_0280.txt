the custom in France. The antiquity of the sweet chestnut at
Tortworth, which be had ascertained from Lord Ducie to be
much exaggerated, he alleges to he no prool that the tree is
indigenous. “The English, or narrowleaved, elm,” he says,
“ being much esteemed hy the Romans, was probably introduced
by them. The box,’' he erroneously (see Hert, 1597, p. 1226.)
states, “is not mentioned by Gerard, and,” he adds, “the
tree is found nowhere in an apparently wild state, except on
Box Hill, where it was planted by Lord Arundel, who designed
to build a house there, but who relinquished his intention from
the want oi water, and built one at Albury hard hy.'’ The
only native everg'reen trees and shruhs of Britain would thus
appear to be tlte Scotch pine, the ltolly, thejuniper‚ the surae,
the spurga laurel, the butcher³s broonr, and the ivy. The furze
Dr. Wallrer supposes not to be aboriginal, but to bava been in·
troduoed irotu the mountains of Portugal, where it abounds.
His reason is, that it is the only alleged indigenous shrub which
flowers during winter3 and that duringsevere winters itis
killed to the ground, both in England aud Scotland. According¹
to these authors, the only indigenous evergreen trees are the
Scotch pine and the holly; so that we are t us reduced to two
evergreen trees and four evergreen shrubs; unless we include
such under-shruhs as ‚the heath, the Andrbmeda, the Arctosth·

Perhaps it maybe thoughtunreasonahle to allege that the
liure and the yew are not natives of Britain, since they unques-
tionahly are of countries which lie farther north3 viz, the north .
’ of Gennany and Swedeu: but it must be remembered that the
summere oi these countries are hotter than those of England, in
consequence of which, the lime ripens its seeds every year, which
it seldom does in Britain. In countries without extremes either
of heat or cold, such as tlte sea coast of Britain and great part of
Ireland, many trees will live aud tbrive without ever producing
seeds. Such trees may remain sor ages in a country, without
being one step nearer naturalisation than the day on which they
were introduced. Iu Hasted's Kent it is stated that Sir John
Speilman, who introduced the manufacture oi paper into England
irorn Germany, in the¹ time of Elizabeth, and to whom Queen
Elizabetb granted the manor of Portbridge in Dartford, intro·
duced the lime trec. He is said to have brought over two trees
with hiin iubis portmanteau, and to have planted thern at Port-
bridge, near the dwelling·house belonging to the powder mills ;
where, according to Hasted, they remained till they were cut
down a few years previously to the tirne when he wrote, which
was in 1776. (Beatsiestffungtand, ἔξω, Kent, p. 569.) The
lime, however, is represented by Turner as growing to a large
size in 15623 so that the trees introduced by Speilntan could
