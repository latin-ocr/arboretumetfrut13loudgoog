not have been the first that were brought into the country. The
Tllia europoe⁸a, or common lime tree of the north of Europe,
is stated by Turner and Gerard to be a native of England3 but
Ray says, that, though it is an inhabitant 01 Essex‚ it is never
found in that county, 01 anywhere else, growing wild. The
Trlia parvifblia, Ray seems to consider as a native.

The box is one of our most interesting “ disputed trees;’'
101, if we are deprived 01 that and 01 the yeW, neither 01 which
Daines Barrington will allow us, our only evergreen trees
will he the Scotch pine and the holly. Ray says that “ the box

there were woods 01 this trec, according to Aubre . It grows
plentifully on the chalk hills near Dunstable.” 'l'urner says,
“it groweth on the mountains in Germany plentifully, wild,
without any setting; but in England it groweth not b itself in
any place that l know, though there is much of it in llnglandss'
(Herbal, edit. 1551, p. 159.) Parkinson says it is found in ·
many woods‚ and that it is also planted in orchards. Evelyn
considers it a native, as does Lambarde, in his Perambulotr'om
‹rsKerm in 1576. Some curicus controversial matter on this
subject will be found in the Gentlcman's Magazine, vol. lvii, for
1787. One writer, T. H. White (p. 667.), says, “ he called at
the village 01 Boxley, and that, from the strictest enquiries‚ he
was thoroughly convinced that Evelyn was wrong in considering
¹the box 10 grow wild at this village.” lt has been said that
the Earl 01 Arundel, who ,died in Italy in 1646, planted the box
trees on Box Hill, with a view 10 building a house there3 but this
is denied by another writer, S. Η, in the samemagazine. ‘⁶ The
Earl 01 Arundel,'' this writer says, “was a very curicus man3 and,
having a house very near, at Dorking, it has been conjectured,
but without foundation, that he planted Box Hill. The ground
on which the box trees grow‚’' he continues, ‘⁶ was not His Lord-
ship’s property ;” and this is confirmed by apassage in Mannin
aud Bray's Swrey, where that part 01 the hill which is covered
with the trees is provedto have belonged to Sir Matthew Brown,
long before the date when they were said to hare been planted
by the earl. “ Various have been the disquisitions,” say these
authors, ‘⁶ concerning the antiquity of this plantation, which,
however, 101 aught that has hitherto appeared 10 the contrary,
may have been coeval with the soil. Here was formerly also a
warren, with its lodge ; in a lease of which, froin Sir Matthew
Brown 10 Thomas Constable, dated 26111 August, 1602, the
tenant covenants 10 use his best endeavours for preserving the
yew, box, and all other trees growing thereupon3 as also to
deliver, half-yearly, an account of what hadr been sold, 10 whom,
aud at what priccs3 and in an account rendered to Ambrose,
