only habitat of this tree in England is Box Hill; and though this
circumstance cannot be considered as a proof that it is not indi-
genous, yet, as it is known that it does not ripen its seeds freely
in this country, and seldom sows itself, citheron Box Hill 01001-

when these circumstances are taken into consideration 011110011-
joined with its Roman name, to doubt whether it be a native. It
isso beautiful a tree, that its branchos, like those of the bay, were
probably in early use both in civic festivals and religious cere-
monies3 and it appears likely 11101 11 was not only introduced,
but was cultivated, at an early period. Arche same time, it must
, not be forgotten, that, in estimating the 'probability of a tree or
plaut being indigenous 10 acountry, we must add to 1110 other
considerations mentioned that of its native habitat. Now the

The trees and shrubs which were known to our 8011011011-
cestors were, the birch, elder, oak, wild or Scotch pine, moun-
tain ash or rowan tree, juniper, elder, swcet gale, dog rose,
heath, St. John's 11011, and the mistletoe. Α11111000 are con-
sidered as aboriginal iu the country; but, from the length of
time that Englaud was under the governruent of the Romans,
it may reasonably be supposed that, in addition to the native
trees and shrubs, there were in the country, when it was taken
possession of by the Saxone, several which were nativas of France,
Spain, or Italy. To what extent this was the case cannot now
be known 3 but it is sufficient for· our purpose, that, in the present
