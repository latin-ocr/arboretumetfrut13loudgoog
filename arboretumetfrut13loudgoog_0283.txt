day, botanists consider all those plants indigenons to a country,
which have existed in it beyond the memory of man or the
existence of written records, and which propagate themselves
freely by seed, without human agency.

The reputed native planta of Britain heve been enumerated
and described by different botanical authors: but it will be 01
little practical use in this case, and in the others which will come
before us, to quote from any author who wrote previously to the
time 01 1100100ος and who, 01 000100, could not adopt his ad·
mirable system of giving plants specific names composed of two
words, instead 01 short Latin descriptions. The first author
who enumerated the plants 01 Εο laud, and applied the Linnaean
specific names, was Hudson, in 10010010 Anglico, published in
1762; and those 01 Scotland were first described by Lightfoot
in his Flora Scotica, in 1775. Those 01 Ireland were first
enumerated by Threllreld in 1727, before the Linnoean system
was adopted, and there has not yet been any other flora of the
country than 0 1101 published by Mr. T. Mackay in tata. For--
tunately, however, there 010 two recent worlrs, the English Flora
01 Sir J. E. Smith, arrd the British Floro 01 Dr. Hooker, which
contain an enumeration and description of 011 1110 plants indige-
nous to the British Isles, and from them we have compiled the
following enumeration. ln it are included 0111110 010010000-
sidered by 110100101000 11300000, which grow in the British
lslands, exclusive 01 varieties.

To such as are considered by many persons aa doubtful
natives, we have prefixed, not the point 01 interrogation used to
signify botanical doubts, but the letters qu.
