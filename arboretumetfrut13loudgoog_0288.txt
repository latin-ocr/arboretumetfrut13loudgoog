British tree culture, began to be introduced into our gardens, as

objecta of rarity end value.
The ornamental trees, or the trees of curiosity, that would first ·

be introduced into any country after those that recommended
themselves by their fruit or their medicinal virtues, would be
such as were generally planted about houses and in gardana,
or such as bore conspicuous seeds. Hence the cypress, the bey,
the box, the elm, the lime, and the plane, as being domestic
shrubs nnd trees3 and the chestnut, the ilex, the walnut, and the
pine, as being trees with conspicuous seeds, would, we may sup·
pose, be those that were first brought over hythe Romans, or
by the heads of religious houses, ambassadors, or travellers. .

ln tracing the introductiou of foreign trees into this country,
from the earliest ages to the present time, we shall first collect
such notices as we have been able to obtain of the period from
the invasion of the country by the Romans, to the end of the
15thcentury3 and, next, take in succession the 161h, l7th,
lssth, aud teth centurias.

Terens can be no dotrbtshnever that the Romans introduced
most of our cultivated vegetahles and fruits. Some curicus

roofs of this are occasionally found in the springing up of
italien-plante in the neighbourhood of the ruins of Roman villas,
where ground, which had long remained in a state of rest, had
*been turned over in search of antiquities. Though, as far as rte
dunow, no trees or shrubs of Italy have sprung up in this manner
from dormant seeds3 yet there cannot he a oubt but that some
of the trees and shrubs of the Romans would hc cultivated in
the gardens of their governors and generals, most of whoiu, itis
understood, must have been practically acquainted with hus·
bandyy. Such trees would not only he interesting to them es
‚remiutling them of their rtative country, but they would serve
todecorate and distinguish their residences, and command the
,admiration of the Roman army and of the nativas.

We have seen, in the preceding chapter (p. 22), that most of
our fruit trees, and in all probability the plane, chestnut, walum,
litus, ehu, and box, were introduced hythe Romans. Many trees
end shrubs introduced hythe Romans, or hythe monlcs of the
middle s, may have been afterwards lostt because this is,
sooner or ater, the case with ull neglected plants that are placed
rn eclimatewhich will not enable thern to ripen their seeds.
