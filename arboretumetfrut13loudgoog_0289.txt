of orcbardsr bnt nothing has reached us respecting the barren
trees and ornamental shrubs of that period, either in France or

England.

n the tenth century, monasteries and other religious esta·
blishnrents began to ahound in the country; and the nronks and
clergy, who were their principal occupants, were generally either
natives of foreign countries, or had been educated in ltaly. The
occupante of monasteries have, in all times, been attached to
gardening3 and, arnon the plants which those of Britain pro·
bably introduced from ltaly, there can be little doubt that fruit
trees were included, and probably, also, sonte trees of ornament,
and shrubs. The sweet bay and the arbutus, if they were not
introduced hythe Romans, were, in all probability, brought
over by the monks. It is conjectured by Dr. Wallier (Essnys
ort Nat. Hirti, that some trees and shrubs were introduced from
the Holy Land duria the tirne of the crusades3 aud one of
these, he thinks, was the English elin. In the dispute already
noticed (p. 20.) between Daines Barrington and Dr. Ducarel,
011 the question 01 the street chestnut being indigenous, the
latter refers to a record, dated 111 the tirne of He'nry 11, by
which the Earl of Hereford grants to Flexby Abbey the tithe
01 1111 his chestnuts in the Forest of Deau. It appears highly
probable that the chestnut, being so productive of hurnan food·
in Italy in the time of the Romans, would be introduced by
thern, whevever they went, as one ol the nrost usesul of trees.

ln the beginning 01 the 13111 century, the apple appears to
have been cultivated to sorue extent in Norfollr. ln the 6th of
King John (1205), Robert de Evernrere was found to hold his
lordsbip 01 Redhara and Stokesly, in Norfolk, by petty serjeantry,
the paying of 200 pearnmins, and 4 hogsheads (modios) oswine
made of peararains, into the exchequer, at the feast oi St.
Michael yearly. (Biorafield's Norfolk, 11212. lto edit, 1810.)

At the beginning of tlte teth century, the roae appears to
have been not only known, but in extensive cultivation. Sin
William Clopton granted to Thomna Smyth a piece of ground
called Dolrmerlwe in Haustede, lor the annual payment ofa rose,
at the nativity of St. John the Baptist, to Sir· Willianr aral his
heirs, in lieu 01 all services, dated at Haustede, on Sunday next
before the Feast 01 All saints, 3Henry lV. (1402). (Callum’s
Haereat, p 117.)

In explanation of this deed, it may first be observed that
ancient deeds are often dated on a Sunday, being executed in
churchea or churchyards, for thqureater notoriety: in the
second place, the rose was then in much' rnore extensive use in
cultivated society than it is now, when its place is partly occu· ’
pied by the great variety of other llowers now in cultivation.

The demand for roses forarerll’ysswas so great, that bushels os
