them were frequently paid by vessels to their lords, both in
France aud England. The single rose paid as an acknowledg-
ment was the diminutive representation of a bushel of roses3 as
a single peppercorn, which is still a reserved rent, is ofa pound
of peppercorns, a payment originally of some worth', descending
by degrees to a mere formality. (Histoire de ta Vie prioe'e des
Franrois, ii. set, and Cullum's Howsted, 117, 118.)

The well-known story of the quarrel in the Temple Gardeus,
about 1450, which gave rise to the distinctions of tlte white and
red rose in the wars ol York aud Lancaster, is in unison with
the loregoing authorities.

Towerds the end of this century, parts for hunting became
common in England, and bushes in gardens were clipped; but
we have no evidence that in either case foreign trees or shrubs
were made use of; unless, with Daines Barrington, 'we reckon
’ theyew trecas such. The yew is mentioned in these times as
subjected to the topiary operatione of the gardener3 and there
appears little doubt that it was theu reckoned one of the princi-
pal gardan shrubs, and almost the only evergreen one. ’ The
trees of the, parks were, in all probability, wholly indigenouS,
and were left to propagate themselves, by shedding their seeds
amon rough herbage3 and tbe extent of snrface they covered

was aflowed to he curtailed by deer and other animals, or to ex·

tend itself, according to the abundance or scarcity of pastura.
Of the foreign trees and shrubs of scotland and lreland, at
this remote period, scarcely any thing is known. James I. is
said to have been an amateur of the fine arts, and to have been
‚fond of gardens, and of grafting fruit trees. James 111. had
gardens in the neighbourhood of Stirling Castle3 and the pear

, trees and chestnuts, which are known to hare existed in Scotland

at that period, may have been introduced from France, with
which country Scotland was theu, and for many years after-
warda, ou intimate terms, or by the Roman clergy. Dr. Walker
mentions a sweet chestnut at Finhaven in Forfarshire, which, in
1760, was conjectured to be upwards of 500 years old, and
which is supposed to have been the oldest planted tree in Scot-
land. (essays, p. 29.)

Still less is known of the introduction of foreign trees and
shrubs into Ireland. The arbutus is thought by some to be
indigenous3 and it is certain that in England, in the l5th cen-
tury, it was called the lrish arbutus. By others, however,
it is said to have been introduced into Killarney by the monks
of St. Finnian, who founded the ebhey of thet name on the
banks of-the lake, in the 6th century.
