Sunsscr. 9. Ostha Foreiga Traer‘ancl Shrubs introduced into Britain
ia the 16111 Century.

Tanna is no record which throws any light on the subject 01
the introduction 01 foreign trees into England previously to the
time 01 Henry VIII. Fitzherbert, in 1523, wrote 011 planting
and preserving trees ior timber and iuel; and Gange, who
translated Heresbachius in 1578, notices the same subjects. In
Turner's Nemesos Herbes in 1548, the trees mentioned are, the
almoud‚ the apricot, the pomegranate, Crstus salviaefblius, rose·
mary, thyma, white jasmine, Spartium junceum, the fig, the
orleutal plane, the elm, the sweet hay, the common black mul-
berry, the stone pine, the spruoe fir, the Cupressus sempervirens,
and the savin. In his Herbal 01 1568, he adds the pasch, the
walnut, and the rue. ln 1568 he adds the lavender. It appears
that foreign trees and shrubs were not altogether neglected
iu the royal gardens, in the time 01 Henry VIII.; since, in a
surrey 01 1111 royal palace at Nonsuch, in Surrey, in the suc·
ceeding century, there were, in the wilderuess, lilaos, lime trees,
yews‚ junipers, and hollies. L'Obel, who published his Adver-
saria in 1570, includes the Jasminum frtiticans, the Pistricis
officinarum, and the Genista Scorpius, among his woody planta.
Tusser‚ iu 1578, mentions the quince and the Damask rose.
Grindal, Bishop 01 Londou, is said by Fuller to have intro·
duced the German tamarisk, about the year 1560 ; but, accordin
to Camden and Hakluyt‚ better authorities, 1110111588. (1111111111
was visited 11 Fulham by the queen, who complained that the
bishop had so surrounded his house with trees, that she could
not enjoy the prospect from her chamber windows. Such ex·
cellent grapes were produced at Fulham by this prelate, that
some were sent every year 10 the queen. (Strype's We of
Gn'ndat.)

Wimbledon House, which was rebuilt by Sir Thomas Cecil
iu 1588, and surveyed by order 01 the parliament in 1649, was
celebrated for its ardens and trees. In the several gardens,
which consisted 01 mares, wildernesses, knots‚ alleys, &c., are
mentioned a reat variety 01 fruit trees, and some shrubs, par-
tioularly “ a 11111 bay tree,” valued at lt, and ‘¹ one very faire
1111, called the Irish arbutis, very lovely to look upon, and
worth ll. los.'’ (Ipsam, i. 897 .) Gerard‚ the first edition 01 whose
Catologue is dated 1596, appears 10 have had s'everal foreign trees
and shrubs in his garden in Holborn3 aud, among others,
althaea frutex, the laburnum, the Judas tree, six different kinds
01 rosea, the laurustinus, the Diospy'rros Ldtus, the white mul·
berry, the nettle 1111, the pinaster, the arbor vitae, the yucca,

and several others, as may bensgen by the list below. ’ 1
