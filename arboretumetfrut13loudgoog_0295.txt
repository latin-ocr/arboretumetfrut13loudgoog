sixteen were introduced. Among these were the sweet bay, the
almund, the apricot, the pomegranate, the mulberry, the pla·
, tanus, the stone plne, the common spruce fir, the cypress, and
the savin juniper. The names of the introducers, or first cul-
tivators, are almost entirely unknown, and, indeed, it is probable
’ that most os the plants named at this early period had been in .
the country mauy years previously; some of them, as the rose-

European countries: the almoud, from Barbary3 aud the jas·

Quercus Flex. The names of the introducere are not known,
with few exceptions3 such as that of Hugh Morgan, apothecary
to Quaen Elizabeth ; Gray, a Loudon apothecnry, mentioned by
L’Obel; L'Obel, a Flemin , who was alierwards botanist to
James1.; and Dr. Grindal, who was bishop of London‚ and after-
wards archbishop of York and Cauterhury, during the greater
part of the reign of Elizabetb. From 1596 to the end of the
century, forty-six different species were introduced, and upwnrds
of thirt of these were first recorded by Gerard. Among these
were, ἵζε English and Scotch laburnums, the althaea frutex, the
Judas tree; the musk, the yellow and the hundred-leaved roses3
the cotoneaster, Christ’s thorn, Comus mas, the common syringa,
the laurustinus, the lilac, and the phillyrea. Most of these are
from the continent and south of Europe3 and there ure, in this
period, als0, the arbor vitre and the yucca, from North America.

Thus, the total number of foreign woody plante which are
known to have been cultivated in Britain during the l6th cen-
tury is only eighty-four, exclusive of two varieties of the lau·
rustinus, and nine of the phillyrea.

It is impossible, at this distance of time, to ascertain the names
of all the persons to whom we are indebted sor the introduction ,
of these plants; but it is certain that the merit oi the first

John Gerard, Pulteney informs us, was born nt Nantwich in

. Chesbire, in 1545, educated as a surgeon, and patronised in

London by Lord Burlei b, who had at that time the best col-
lection of plants in the iringdom. Gerard superintended this
nobleman’s garden, which was in the Strnnd ; Gerard himself
living in Holborn‚ where he had a physic garden, considered
