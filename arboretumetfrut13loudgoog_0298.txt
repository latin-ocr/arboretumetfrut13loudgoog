garden3 and ol this ou meet with a great variety of examples in
the treatises ol Dr. Ilukenea Hermann, and Commelyn. Botani·
cal much more even than other worldly affairs are subject to
great fluctuatione, and this arises not only from the natural

ecay of vegetables, aad their being injured by the variety of
seasons, but also from the genius and disposition of the pos-
sessors orthem. So, here, upon the death of Bishop Compton,
all the green-house plants and more render exotio trees were, as
Iam informed b Sir Hans Sloane, given to the ancestor of
the present Earl ylney at Wanstead. And as the sucoessors
ol this bishop in the see of London were more distinguished
for their piety and learning than for their zeal in the promotion
of natural knowled e, the curiosities of this garden were not
attended to, but tela to the management of ignorant persons3
so that many of the hardy exotio trees, however valuable‚ were
removed to make way for the more ordinary productione of the
kltchengardenl' (Phil. Trana, xlvii. 248.)

Collinson‚ speaking of Bishop Robinson, Dr. Compton's suc·
cessor, says, he was a man of “ no such taste’' as Bishop Comp-
ton. “He allowed his gardener to sell what he pleased, and
osten spoiled what he could not otherwise dispose of. Many
fine trees, come to great maturity‚ were eut down, to make room
for produce for the table. Furber of Kensington, and Gray of
Fulham, au ented their collections from this source, with ”
plants not ot erwise to be procured.’'
