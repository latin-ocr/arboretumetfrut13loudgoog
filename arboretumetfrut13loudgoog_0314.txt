his will is given in the Gentleman's Magazine, vol. xxxi. p. 206,
in which the duke gives one year's weges to each of his servants
in London, and to Daniel Crafr, his gardener at Whitton, and
to his bousekeeper there, except, says His Grace, ‘⁶ my cook,
whose weges ere too high.'’ The duke, who succeeded to that
title in 1742, collected all the foreign trees and shrubs which, at
that time, were to be procured either ethome or abroad: many
of the former still remain at Whitton, but all those removable
were sent to the Princess Dowager ο1 Wales's gardera at Kew,
in 1762, after the duke's death, his paternal property and duke-
dom going to a distant relative. The grounds were sold and
divided, and now form three distinct villas, which are remarkable
for their fine specimens of cedars, Weymouth pines, silver firs,
deciduous cypressos, walnuts, hickories, and American oaks.

In February, 1885, through the kindness of the Missas Gost-
ling, the present proprietors of Whitton Place, and the assistance
of Mr. Castle, ο1 the Twickenbam Botanic Garden, and ol
Mr. West, gardener at Whitton, a number of the trees were
measured sor us. Among these are, a Lombardy poplar 115 11.
high, and 19 st. 8 in. in girt at 211. from the ground; a cedar
of Lebanon 71 11. high and 14 ft. in girt; asilver fir 95 11. high,
and 1011. 6in. in girt; a Weymoutb pine 81 11. high, and
11 11. 8 in. in girt; a Quercus Phellos (the willow oak) 70 11.
high3 and n black hickory 6011. high. There are a number
of other fine trees, larches, lirs, pines, oaks‚ robinias, gleditschias,
810, on this and other portions ο1 the estate, of which notices will
be found in the Garri. Mag, vol. xi.

The seat of the Lord Petre so highly eulogised by Collinson
was at Thorndon Hall in Essex3 and that place still contains
some fine old exotio trees Speaking ο1 Robert Lord Petre, ’
Collinson, in a letter to Linnaeus, dated Jan. 18. 1743, observes
that “the death of the worthiest of men, the late Lord Petra,
has been the greatest loss that botany or gardening ever felt in
this island. He spared no pains or expense to procura seeds
'and plants from all parts of the world, and then was as ambitious
to preserve them.” After speaking of his stores as such ‘⁶ as

the world never saw, and may never see again,'' and giving the ⁸

dimensions of the more remarkable plants grown in them, be
says, ‘⁴ the collections of trees, shrubs, and evergreens in his
nurseries athis death, 1 had told over3 and they amounted to
219,925‚ mostly exotio. As this young nobleman was the
greatest man in our toste that this age produced, I thought it
might not be unacceptable to give you some account of the
greatness of his genius; but his skill in all the liberal arts, par·
ticularly in architecture, statuary, plannin , and designing,
planting‚ and embellishing his large park and gardens, exceeds

my taient to set forth.'’ (Smitlr's Linnaecn Cmemondmce, vol. i.
