Babanra Islauds. All the most interesting trees 01 America ara
beautifnllyfi red in these volumem and the appearance of such
figures for e first time, in Englaud, must bave greatly con-
tributed tc induce the wealthy to procura the introduction of
the trees they represented into this country. Ryall, who wrote
the preface to Catesby's Home Americamts Europam (which
was not published titt 1767, nearly twenty years after Catesby's
death), observes, “ that very little regard was had 10 the trees
and abraba of Ameriae on our first settling in that'countryr nor,
indeed, was any considerable step taken about introducing them
into England till about the year 1720? chiefly in consequence
of Mt. Catesby’s exertions, Catesby lived many years at
Hoxtonr but iu the latter part of his life he removed 1ο F ul·
ham, where he occupied a house, and had a garden within the
site of what is now the Fulham Nursery, in which some trees
remain that were planted with his own band. (Ipsam, vol. ii.
p. 829.) Catesby was born in 1679, and died in 1749. In a
notice 01 his death, in the Geretlemnn's Megarice for 1749
(xx. 80.), he is called the “ truly honest, ingenious, and modest
Mr. Mark Catesby.'’

Historycf Coroliaa (which, in January, 1835, came into the

, possession of A. Β. Lambert, Esq.), is the following curicus

memorandum in Mr. Collinson’s own handwritinfi’ and signed

with bis name, “The ingenious author, Mr. ark Catesby,
was born of a gentleman's family at Sudbury in Suffolk. Some
of his family being settled in Virginis, and having himself a turn
of mind to natural history, he went over there to see his sister
and improve bis genius. From thence he travelled to Carolina,
Bahama lslands, &c., and painted all the subjecta from the lif .

in accomplisbing the work, being himself the principal operator.
so noble and so accurate a performance, be‘pan and fiuished by
one hand, is not to be paralleled: hut it a orded a subsistence
