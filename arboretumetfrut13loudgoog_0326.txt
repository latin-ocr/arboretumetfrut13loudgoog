Mr. John Ellis was remarkable for bis exertions in devising
plans for importing aoorns and other nuts and seeds of
American trees, which through his means were thus brought .
over in large quantities. l·le wasa contemporary of Collinson,
aud, like him, was early in life engaged in merchandise3 but
he afterwards became agent for West Florida in 1764, and for
Dominica in 1770. He hada very extensive correspondence,
and was the means of introducing many articles of natural
history, besides trees and shrubs. He was the author of
ΤΙιε Natural History of Corallines, ’1711 Natural History of
zoophytes, &c., and established the genera Haldsia, Gordbnr'a,
Gardenr'a, and others. As a proof of the amiable feeling that
subsisted 11 that time between English and F rench naturalists,
maybe mentioned, that, during the war, Duhamel, who was then
(1757) at the head of the french marine establishment, promised
to Ellis and Collinson to return whatever planta were taken by
the French. John Ellis died in 1776, aged 66.

Alexander Garden‚ M.D.‚ wasa Scotch physician, settled at

Charlestown, in South Carolina, where he married in 1755, and
died in 1791, in his aad year. He sent home a number of
American trees and shruhs, including the Ptelea, the fringe
tree, several species of Magnblr'a‚ deia integrifblia, 811. Lin-
noeus intended the loblolly bey, called Lasidnthus (now Gor·
dbnr'a Lasihnthus)‚ to he named after him, which honour Dr.
Garden solicited 3 but, unfortunately, his letter arrived too late by
a mouth, Mr. Ellis having, in the meantime, narned it Gorddnia.
Another genus, the Garddnia, commemoratas the name ο1 this
ardent naturalist·
Subse uently 1ο the year 1780, foreign trees and shrubs appear
to havelam planted in various country seats, and more espe-
cially in those laid out in ’the modern style. Among the earliest
of these are included Stowe, and part of the scenery at Blenheim.
At the former are some line old cypresses, cedars, and 1111111,
planted in Brown’s time; and in the latter were, till lately, the
olrlest decidaoas cypresses and Lombard poplars in England.
We believe the very first place in which the Dutch style was
made to give way 1ο the English manner was Corby Castis, iu
Cumberland, which began to display the new taste so early as
1706 (Warner); hut it does not appear that many foreign trees
were lanted.

Palhs Hill was planted hythe Honourable Charles Hamilton,
sixth son of the Earl of Aberoom, about the same time that
Wobum Farm was laid out, viz. 1785. Mr. Hamilton not only
indulged the public with 1 sight of his improvements at Pains
Hilt; but allowed strangers the use of low chairs, drawn by
