small horses, which were provided at the inns at Cobham, to go
over the grounds. In the latter part of his life, Mr. Hamilton
retired to Beth, having sold his place to Benjamin Bond Hop-
kins, Esq, who built the present house, the original one being
small. (Maaniag and Bray’s Surrey, ii. 768.) Among the trees
remaining at Pains Hill are some remarkably fine silver cedars,
pinasters, and other pines, American oaks, cork trees, and ilices,

rhododendrons and azalibs introduced into England were
planted by Mr. Thaburn, who was gardener to ΜΓ. Hamilton,

and who afterwards became an eminent nurseryman at Old ’

Brompton. Bowood was laid out about the same time by the
first Marquess of Lansdowne (then Earl of Shelburne), who
was assisted by Mr. Hamilton of Pains Hill; and, like that
place, it was planted with every kind of foreign tree tlrat could
be procured at the time. Many of these trees still remeia,
and have attained a large siae: the cedars and tulip trees are
remarkably fine. Woburn Farm, which began to be improved
by ΜΓ. Southcote in 1735, belongs to this class of places3 and
also Strathfieldsaye ε the former contains one of the largest liquid·
ambar trees in England, a remarkably fine hemlock spruce, very
large tulip treeS, acacias, hickories, pines, cedars‚ and cypresses,
and a magnificent cut-leaved elder. At Strathfieldsafiye are the
largest hemlock spruce in England, some remarkably ne scarlet
oalrs, a large tupelo tree, and many fine pines and firs. Clare·
mont, planted about the same time by Brown, for Lord Clive,
contains a great many exotic trees, particularly cedars of large
dimensions. There are very large ilices, cork trees, tulip trees,
red cedars, a large hemlock spruce, and many other fine speci-
mens of foreign trees. Oatlands, Ashley Park, and more par-
ticularly Lord Taukerville's at Walton, were planted soon after
this period, and contain many fine specimens. ’
Upton House, near Stratford in Essex, was planted by Dr.
Fothergill about 17623 and, though many of the shrubs were
sold at the doctor's death in 178 l, the grounds still contain many
large and fine specimens. Of these we had the following mea·
sured inJanuary, 1835: P‘opulus cenedensis, 100 ft. high;
P. dilatata, 120 ft. high; Quercus Trirneri, 50 ft. high; Corylus
Colr‘rrna, with a trunk alt in circumference, and forming a very
handsome trec which bears abundantly every year3 Cupressus
sempervlrens horizontalis, solt. high, a fine specimen; two very
large cedars, with trunks 9} ft. in diameter, at 6ft. from the
ground; a large corlr tree; K'olreuteria paniculfita, 40 a. high,
perhaps the largest in England; a large robinia, &c Collinson
states that the A¹rbutus Andrfichne flowered for the first time
in this garden, in May, 1766. He adds that the plant was¹
