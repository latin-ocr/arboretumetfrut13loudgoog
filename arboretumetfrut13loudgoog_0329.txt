Syon was one of the 101 001 monasteries that were suppressed.
It 1100 10 Henry vl11.’s fanda at his death3 and his funeral
procession, which is said to have exceeded in magnificante any·
thing of the kind either before or since, was rested a night at
Syon on its way to Windsor. King Edward VI. granted Syon
to Edward Duke of Somerset, who built the shell 01 the present
mansion. He had a botanic gardan there, mentioned by Turner
(who was his physician) iu his Herbul. In 1604, we find Syon
House in the possession 01 Henry Earl of Northumberland,
who had laid out 90001. 00 the house and gardens. The house
was afterwards greatly enlarged and improved by Inigo Jonas,
in 1659. The grounds at Syon are generally understood to
have been laid out in their present form by Brown, between 1750
0011 1760. They were planted with all the foreign hardy trees
and shrubs that could be procured‚ at that time, in the Londou
nurseries3 and the place now contains many very 11000111 speci·
10000010011010, pines, planes, gleditschias, robinias, catalpas, aud
more especially of deciduous cypress. ,

George william, sixth Earl of Coventry‚ succeeded to the title,
and to 1110 001010 01 Croome d’Abitot, in the year 1738, being
then 17 years of age. He soon afterwards, with the assistance
of Brown, began to improve the estate, at that time “a mere
bo ‚ and a barren waste'' (Deon's Oroome Guide, 1810031),
and soon converted it into fertile soil, and planted it with all the
useful and 01001000101 11000 0011 shrubs at that time to be pro·
cured in the nurseries. The plants 11010 grown with astonishing
vigour‚ and there is now at Croome an extensive collection 01
species, containing some 01 the 110001 specimena of foreign 11000
0011 01110110 10 the country.

Numerous gentlemen's seats, planted about this time in every
part of England, might be cited as containing fine old specimens
of foreign tree's and shrub's3 but we must limit ourselvas to a
few which took a laad in this toste. Among these may be men·
tioned, in addition to those already noticed‚ Busbridge, near Go-
dalming‚ in Surrcy, in 1751, in the possession of Philip Carteret
Webb, Esq.‚ and frequently mentioned by Miller; Mount Edge·
combe, Earl 01 Μο001 Edgecombe3 Mamhead, now belonging to
W. Newman, Esq.; Powderham Castis, Earl 01 Devon; High
Clare, Earl of Caernarvon3 and Chiswick, Duke 01 Devonshire.
