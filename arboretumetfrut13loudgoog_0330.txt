being quoted than several of those named; but, as we have
invited all proprietors and gardeners in the British lsles tn send
us accounts of their foreign trees and shrubs for this work, and
as many of these have done so, we must refer in this place to
the paragraph headed Statistics, given to each tree and shrub;
where, under each county, will be found the names of all those
scats most remarkable for foreign trees and shrubs‚ with the
dimensions and other particulars of the plants they contain.

Several botanic gardens were formed during this century,
both at home and abroad3 and the exchange of seeds and
planta which takes place universally among such establishments
increased the foreign productione of each respective country.
It also became the practice, in the latter part of this century,
for private persons and public bodies ιο send out botanical
collectors. Several of these were sent out from the Royal
Gardens at Kew, others by the subscriptions of individuale, and
some by nurserymen.

Chelsea Garden (already nodosd, p. 47.) is said by Collinson
ιο have been, in his time, the richest in plants in Europe. It
was brought to the highest degree of eminence during this
century by Miller. Its origin is unknown: the first notice
of it, in the books of the Apothecaries’ Society, is in 1674,
when it was proposed to wall it round3 and two years aller·
wards, in 1676, the Society agreed ιο purchase the planta
growing in Mrs. Cape's garden at Westminster. They may
probably also have had planta from the garden mentioned in
Evelyn’s Diary for 1658 as “the medical garden at West·
minster, well stored with plants, under [Edward] Morgan,
a skilful botanist.” Piggot is the name of the first curator of
the Chelsea Garden, noticed in 1676. Watts, mentioned both
by Ray and Evelyn, was an apothecary by profession, but
undertook the care of the garden in 1680, at 501. perannum.
Miller was appointed ιο the garden 1111726, at the time Sir
Hans Sloane, when applied ιο for a renewal of the lease of
the garden, granted it ιο the Society in perpetuity, at a rental
of 6l. per annum, and on condition that specimens of fisty
new planta should annually be furnished ιο the Royal
Society, till the number amounted ιο two thousand, that
number, at that time, being supposed likely ιο exhaust the
botanical riches of the whole world. Miller resigned his
situation as curator, a short time before his death in 1771, and
was suoceeded by Forsyth, who lest it to become royal gardener
at Kensington in 1781, and vvas suoceeded by Fairbairn,
who died in the garden in 1811. His situation is now filled
by Mr. William Anderson, F.L.S. H.s.‚ διο, who has greatly

enriched the garden, and contributed materially to its present
high character.
