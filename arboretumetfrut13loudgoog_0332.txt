Various other gardana might be mentioned as having contri-
buted to spread a taste for forei n trees and shruhs towards the
latter end of this century; and enames of a number of writers
on hotany and gardening would also deservo commemoration
here, were they not already recorded in the historical part of
our Eutyclopaedr'o of Gardaning.. The reader who thinks we
might have extended this part of our work will bear this in
mind; and also that it has been our object, throughout this
Introduction, to repeat nothing which we have already laid

The only extensive nursery at the beginning of this century
was, as we have before seen (p. te), that of Brompton Park‚
occupied by London and Wise. Those of Gray of F olbam, of
Furber of Kensington, of Fairchild of Hortor, Gordon of Mile
End, and Hunt of Putney‚ becanm eminent before the middle

This nursery is now in the poasessibn of Messrs. Whitley and
Osborne, and still retains its reputation for American treesand
