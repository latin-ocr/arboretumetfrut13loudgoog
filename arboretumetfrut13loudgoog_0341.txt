greater number of trees and shrubs introduced were received by
Conrad Loddiges, and chiefly from William Bartram, the son of
John. The Bartrams, indeed, and Andre Michaux, were the
ggeat collectore of American plants during the18th century.

ichaux sent almost ever thing to Frence, by the government
of which he was employed ; but the Bartrams were Americans,
and corresponded chiefly with the Kew Botanic Garden, and
with the London nurserymen and amateurs. A number of trees
and shrubs were introduced during the leth century by John
Fraser, but the chief accessions to the British arboretum and
fruticetum made by this indefatigable collector were in the
succeeding century.

John Bartram, one of the most distin ished of American
botanists, was bom in Chester County‚ ffunsylvanin in 1701.
His grandfather, of the same name, accompanied William Penn
to this country in 1682. John Bartram was a simple farmer3
he cultivated the ground for subsistence, while he indulged arr
insatiable desire for botany. He was sslf-taught in that science,
and in the rudiments of the learned languages, and medicine
aud surgery. So great, in the end, was his prolicieucy in his
favonrite pursuit, that Linnaeus pronounced him ‘⁸ the greatest
natural botanist in the world.” He made excursions‚ in the in-
tervals of agricultural labour, to Florida and Canada, herborising
with intense zeal and delight. At the ageos 70, he performed a
joumey to East Florida, to explere its natural pr·o‹luctions; at

at the present time, within the limits of the United States.· He
first formed a botanic gardan in America‚ for the cultivation of
American plants as well as exotics. This garden, which is
situated on the banks of the Schuylkill, a few miles from Phila·
delphia, still bears his name. He contributed much to the
gardens of Europe, and corresponded with the most distinguished
naturalists of that quarter of the globe. Several forei n societies
and academias bestowed their honours upon him, aad published
communicatione from him in their Transactions. John Bartram
died in 1777, in the 76th year of his age. At the time of his
death he held the office of American botanist to George Ill. of
England. He was amiable and charitable, and of the strictest
probity and temperance. (Encyc. Amet.)

William Bartram, fourth son of John Bartram, was born in
1789, at the Botanic Garden, Kingsessing, Pennsylvania. At the
age of 16 years he was placed with a respectable merchant of
Philadelphia, with whom he continued six years; after which he
went to North Carolina, with a view of doing business there as .
a merchant: but, being ardently attached to the study of botany,

he relinquished his mercantile pursuits, and accompanied his
