father in a journey into East Florida, to explora the natural
productione of that country3 after which he settled on the river
St. John’s, in that region, and finally returned, about the year
1771, to his father's residence. In 1773, at the request of Dr.
Fothergill of London, be emberked for Charleston, to examine
the natural productions of the Floridas and the western parts of
Caroliua and Georgia, chiefly in the vegetable kingdom. ln this
employment he was engaged nearly five years, aa rnede nume-
rous contributione to the natural history of the country through
which he travelled. His collections and drawin were forwarded
to Dr. Fothergill; and about the year 1790 artram published
an account of his trarels and discoveries in one volume 8vo, with
an account of the manners and customs of the Creeke, Chero-
kees, and Choctews. This work soon acquired extensive popa·
larity, and is still frequently consulted. After his return from
his travels, he devoted himself to scienoe, and, in 1782, was
elected professor of botany in the university of Pennsylvania,
which post he declined in consequence of the state of his health.
In 1786 he was elected a member of the American Philosophical
Society, end wasa member of several other learned societies in
Europe and Ameriae. We are indebted to him for the know-
ledge of many carious and beautiful planta peculiar to North
Ameriae, and for the most complete and correct table of Arne·
rican ornithology, before the work of Wileon‚ who was assisted
by him in the commencement of his American Omithology. He
wrote an article on the natural history of a plant a few minutes
before his death, which happened suddenly, by the rupture afa

agla dcl-hltllaird, as we have seen (p. 48.), very little was done in
the way of introducing foreign trees and sbrubs‚ during the
seventeenth century; though the rudimenta of this description
of improvement were laid about the eud of it, by the establish-
ment of the Ediuburgh Batanic Garden. In Nicolson's Scottivla
Historicol Library, published in 1702, this gardan is stated to
have been brought to the highest degree of perfectiora by its
curator, ΜΓ. James Sutherland‚ “ whose extraordinary skill aad
industry’' are said to have greatly advanced this department of
natural history in Scotland. ln Sihbald’s Scotr'a Illustrata,
publishedin1684‚ the Edinburgh Batanic Garden is said to
contain an arboretum, in which was “every kind of trae and
shrub, -as well barren ae fruit-bearing, the whole disposed in
fair order'' (p. 66.); and in Sibbald's Memoria Balfouriaaa,
published in 1698, this gar-den is said to be ‘⁶ the greatest orua-
ment of the city of Edinburgh·’' (p. 73.) The plante of this
garden have been twice removed to other situations (first in
1767, and again in 1822), and we believe there is now neither a
