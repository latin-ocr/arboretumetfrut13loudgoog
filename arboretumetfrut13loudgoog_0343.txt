trec nor a shrub on the original site Notwithstanding the ex-
ample shown by the arboretum in the Botanic Garden, how·

ever, the planu'ng of foreign trees and shrubs still appears to
have been but little practised in Scotland. Apublic gardan,
to contaln fruit trees, it appears, was projected for Edinburgh so
early as 1662. Maitland informs us that the town council of
Edinburgh, “ by their act of l5th of March, 1662 (Coun. Rep,
vol. xxi. f. 99.), demisedto John Thomsona gardener, for a term
of nineteen years, the plot of ground at present called Parliaurent
Closs, with the brae or side of the hill, inclosed with a stoneru
wall ;'’ and that ‘⁶ ‘the said Thomsone was to plant a hedge
as the eastern boundary! This spot, of ground, according to
the tenour of the taclt, or lease, was to be laid out in walks, aud
to be planted with trees, herba, and llowers, exclusive of cabbage,
and other common gardan stuff. Pursuant to the above agree-
ment, Thomsone, on the 8th of April following, delivered to the
council a plan for beautifying the inclosure, which was approved
of.'' Two walks were to be made, a larger and a less one,
from east to west; and “their western end, opposite to the

Parliament House, was ordered to be planted with plum and .

cherry trees; aud to be bordered with gooseberry, currant, and
rose bushes3 and flowers to be set along the southern wall or
wooden rail at the head of the brae, or brow of the hill; and, at
the eastern end, as aforesaid, a hedge.’' (Maitland’s Hirr. <ff
udin, p. 186.) It seerns, however, from a subsequent passage,
that the plan for this garden was never carried into execution,
and that the eastern boundary of the Parliament Close was
let soon after for building small shops. Reid, iu his Scovs
Gardrner, published in 1683, mentions very few trees and
shrubs. The rnost rare of these are, the ever reen oalr, the
cypress, and the arbutus. He says there are t elndian and
Spanish jasmines, myrtles, oleanders, and orange trees, which
sorne are at great pains in governing; but he adds, “ for rny
part Ι would rather he in the woods, parks, δια, measuring,
planting, and improvin .'' (p. 112.) Those wlro are curicus in
trees and other plants, he refers to the catalogue of the “learned
and most ingenious Mr. James Sutherland, Physic Gardener
at Edinburgh.'' (p. 114.) lt appears by an Essay on Enalort'ng,
Plauting, dra, in Scotland, published in Edinburgh in 1729, that
there was “ but a very little stock of trees, either barren, fruit,
or hedging quicksets. One who encloses,'' continues the author,
“ rnnst get his quicksets from England or Holland, or he rnust
sow Devonshire or French whin seed.’' (p. 289.)

lt is fortunate for the historian of tree culture in Scotland,
that such a writer existed before him as the late Dr. Wallrer,
professor of natural history in the university of Edinburgh.
This excellent man, whose garden we have seen in our younger
