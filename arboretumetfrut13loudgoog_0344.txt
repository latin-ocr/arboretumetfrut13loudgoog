Dr. Walker informs us, between the years 1760 and 17863
aad, as will appear from the following extracta, they are of very
greptrpetefirresstt.troes planted by art in Scotland,” says Dr. Walker‚
‘⁶ were those of foreign growth, and especially the fruit-bearing
trees. Long before the Reformation, various orchaid fruita,
brought probably from France were cultivated in the gardens
of the religious houses in Scotland. Some of these fruit trees,
planted, perhaps, but a little before the Reformation, still remain.
A few exotio barren trees were likewise propagated, such as the
elder and the sycamore, and, at a later date, the beech and the
chestnut; but none of our native trees were planted, such as the
fir [pine], oak‚ ash, alm, and birch, till about the beginning of
the last century. The first exotio tree of the barren kind
planted in Scotland seems to have been the elder. Though a
slow-growing and long-lived tree, many generations of it have

succeeded each other in that country. Eldertrees of a large

size and very ancient date still appear; not only about od
castles‚ but about the most considerable and oldest farm-houses.
It was very generally planted, and for a very useful and peculial·
purpose, the wood of the elder being accounted‚ in old times,
preferable to every other sort for the making of arrows. The
plane [sycamore, Acer Pseddo·Platanus]‚ in point of antiquity‚
appears to be the next. When it was first introduced is unaec·

been propagated by seeds and suckers, for several generations
before any other forest tree was introduced into Scotland. The
wood of this trec, in old times, must have been of great value in
the hands of the turner3 and for that purpose chiefly it seems
to have been cultivated. lt is better adapted forthe wooden
bowls, dishes, platters, and other domestic utensils which were
universally in use, than the wood of any native tres in the
country. These, however, the elder and the sycamore, appear
to have been the only two barren trees planted in Scotland, till ’
towards the middle of the seventeenth century.”

Perhaps the oldest sycamore in Scotland, and which appears
to be at the same time the largest trae of the kind in Britain, is
