. that at Kippenross,in Perthsbire. ln 1823, it measured 28 ll.
9in. ia circumference, at a foot from the und. It appears,

. from a statement made by the Earl ol llldroto Mr. Monteith,
that this tree went by the name of “the big tree in Kippenross”
iu the time of Charles 11. (Montettt’s Forester’s Gaiae, ad edit.

· p. 894.) In the grounds of Callendar Hoase, near Pallidi,
there are sycamores and other trees of great siae, which must
have been planted at the commenceurent of the reth century, 11
not in ‚the latter part of the t'lth century. Dr. Graham states,
on authority which he considera almost approachin to a cer·
tainty, that these trees were planted hythe Earl of inlithgow
and Callendar, who had accompenied Charles ll. in his exile,
upon his return from the Continent, aster the Rectoration. The
dimensione of these remarkable trees are given in the appendix
to the General Report <ff scotland, vol. iv. p. 482.

We are not aware ol any elder trees in Scotland ο1 any great
siae ornindicating great age. The trec is so completely natural·
ised there, more especially about houses and places where culti·
vation bas long existed, that, if it were notior· DnWallrer's
statement, we should never have supposed it to be otherwise
than an indigenous tree.

The sweet chestnut and the beech, producing secde easily
portable from other countries, were in all probability introduced
into Scotland by the Romans, and, perhaps, reintroduced hythe
religious establishments in the middle ages. According to Dr.
Walker, “ a lew chestnuts and becches were first planted in
gardeus not long before the middle of the serenteenth century,
some ο1 which have remained till our own times. Such was the
chestnut at Finhaven3 another at Levenside in Dumbartonshire,
which was thrown down hythe hurricane in 17893 and two or
three, which were alive and vigorous, at Kinsauns in Perthshire,
in the year 1761. Such was the great beeeh at Taymouth,
overturned by a storrn some years ago; the beech at Oxensord3
that at Newbattle in Mid Lothian ; and another at Ormiston Hall
in East Lothian.''

The two last-named beech trees, we conclude, from Sir Thos.
Dick Lauder’s notes respecting them in his edition ο1 Gilpin’s
Forest somery, vol. i. p. 266, are decayed3 and we believe that
the largest beech trees now existing in Scotland areat Ardlrin-
glass in Argyllshire, and one mentioned by Mr. Sang (Planter's
Calendar, ad edit. p. 52.) as growing at Panmure in Forsar·
shira. The latter is att st. 61η. in circumference, at the surface of
the ground ; and the former as large, with a longer stem and a
finer head. (Gilpin, dyc, p. 267.) One of the largest sweet chest-
nuts in Scotland is at Caim Salloch in Dumlriesshire3 at 2 st.
from the surface of the ground it measures 26 st. in girt3 and it
is divided into four large arms, 26 ft, te lt, 81 ll, and 28 st. in
