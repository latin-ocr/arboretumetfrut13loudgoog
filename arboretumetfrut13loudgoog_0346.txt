length. There is a very old tree at Ricoarton, near Edinburgh,
which has been described and figured by Sir Thomas DicltLauder.
The trunk is much injured and decayed3 but its boughs and
foliage ure 01 luxuriant growth3 the branches hang down to the
ground, and, in many places, have rooted into it. The truultis
87 st. in girt at the surface 01 the ground, and the branches
cover au area 01 7711. 111 diameter. (leid. p. 868.)

Dr. Walker mentions (11818.) some sweet chestnuts which
he found, about 1760, in a thriving condition in the leland 01
Inchmahona‚ in the Lake 01 Menteith‚ iu Perthshire, where there

· wus a priory founded by King David Ι. Dr. Patrick Graham

measured some 01 these trees iu 1818, and found the trunhs to
be 18 st. in circumference at 6 11. from the ground. (Generol
Report (ff Scotlaud, vol. ii. p. 854.) He thinks they were theu
800 years old, 01 upwards, which would carry the date 01 their
planting back to the commencement 01 the sixteenth century.
According to Dr. Wallter, as before quoted (p. 841, the sweet
chestnut at Finhaven was both the largest tree 01 the kind in
Scotland‚ and the first tree planted there by art. “ In the year
1760, agreat pert 01 the trunk 01 this remarkable trec, and
some 01 its branchos, remained. The mensures 01 this tree were
taken before two justices 01 the peace, in the year 1744. By
an attested copy 01 this measurement, it appeared, at that time,
that at half a loot above the ground, it was tart. 81111111
circumference. Aa this chestnut appears, from its dimensions,
to have been planted about 500 years ago, it may be presumed
to be the oldest planted tree that is extant, or that we have any
account 01, 111 Scotland.'’ (Wullcer's Essuya p. 89.) sir Thomas
Dick Lauder states, that, ‘⁶ in the possession 01 Skene 01 Car·-
riston, there is a table madeus the wood of this trae, havingan
engraved plate, on which are marked its dimensione. The castle
01 F inhaven was an ancient seat 01 the Earls 01 Cruwford.’'
