Teymouth, in the central highlands 01 Perthshire, is a very
old seat ol the Camphells. Pennent says the castle was first
built by Sir John Cemphell, sixth knight of Lochow, who died
in 1583. The place, he says, has been much modemised since
the days 01 the founder, end has lost its castellated form, as well
11 its old name of Bulloch Cestle. The place has subsequently
undergone 1 1111 variety of alterations, and at present is 11-
“ markable for lise extent of its woods and plantatione, end for a
fine avenueof lime trees. The present proprietor is John Camp-

bell, Marquess os Breedalbeue.
