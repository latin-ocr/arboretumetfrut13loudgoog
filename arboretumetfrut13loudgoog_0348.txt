Duke 01 Argyll. Itis a magnificent place, from its at extent,
with the sea in front, and backed by wooded hils and lofty
mountains. The house is an immense quadrangular building,
and with the plantations and plausere-grounds, are said to have
cost, within the lest half century, upwards 01 30110001. The
Portu llaurel was introduced here in 1695, and is said to have
been lirought 11001 Portugal by Duke Archibald; one tree
spreads over a circle 01 165 ll. in circumference, and is nearly
40 ft. high. 10 Smith’s Agrimltwal Report of Argyllsln're, the r
oldest and largest trees at lnversry are supposed to have been
planted by the Marquess 01 Argyll (frequently mentioned by
Evelyn as a great planter), between the years 1650 androco.
Those 01 the next largest aize and age were raised 11010 seed by ·
Archibald Duke 01 Ar ll in 171601 1747. These latter con-
1111 chiefly 01 larches, ew En land pines, and spruce and silver
firs. (Report, dc, p. 156.) 110 soil and climate at Inverary ·
are said to be remarkably favourable 101 the growthof trees.

Prestonfield is a well known place in the. neighbourhood 01
Edinburgh, which, in 1788, belonged to Sir Alexander Diels, a
great horticulturist as well as agriculturist, and distinguished
by having been the first to produce good medicinal rlrubarb in
Scotland. (See Wight's Husbandry osScotland, vol. iii. pt. ii.
p. 443.) Kinross was built and planted, about 1685, by
Sir William Bruce, the celebrated architect, 101 his own re-
sidente, and was the first good house 01 regular architecture in
Scotland. lt was approached by 01100 evenne of trees. Drum-
lanrig, in Dumfriesshire, was built by the Duke 01 Queensberry
iu a commanding situation: it took ten years in building, and
was finished in 1689. The duke expended an immense sum in
forming terraced gardens, which, according to Gilpin (0111110-
ations, dc, in Scotlunrl, 1776), served only to deiorm a very 110-Ι
lightiul piece of scenery. The duke, he adds, seems to have
been aware 01 his fully, 101 he is said to have “ bundledup all
the accounts together, and inscribed them with a grievous curse
on any of his posterity who should ever look into them.'’. Tne
property now belongs 10 the Duke 01 Buccleugh and Quaene-
berry, who is planting and building there very extensively. ·(See
