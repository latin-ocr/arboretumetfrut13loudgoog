Hamilton, close hythe pellace, being the only rden for the
sale of plants mentioned by Reid in his Scots ardener, pub·
lished in 1686. Among the oaks of Hamilton Park, so famous
down to the end of the serenteenth century, there were trees,
Nasmyth informs us, which measured 27 feet round the trunk,
with wide expansive branches. (Agricrdture os OEpdesdale, p. 144.)

Panrnure is the name of an ancient family in Angusshire, whose ,
chief seat is the spacious and hospitable mansion of Brechin
Castle, which, from the remotest periodos its history, has always ·
been possessed by the Maules, formerly Earls of Panmure.
Panmure, another seat of this family, is near Duudee, and was
built about 1665. Itis a venerable fabric, and is kept by the
proprietor, with all its furniture and pictures, in the same state
in which it descended from his ancestors. In Dr. Walker’s
time, Panmure was famous for its laburnums, which were planted
towards the end of the serenteenth century, and had attained a
great size in 1760. Sang says that a considerable quantity of
the laburnums at Panmure and Brechin were cut down in 1809,
andksold by public sale at fully lor. od. a foot, chiefly to cabinet-
ma ers.

New Posso, in Peeblesshire, was formerly called Dalwick,
Dewick, or Daick. It helon ed, in very ancient times, to the
chiefs of every considerable demil of the name of Veitcht but, ,
in 1715, it was in the possession oly Sir James Nasmyth of Posso, χ
an eminent lawyer, who rebuilt the house and gardan, and by
some ornamental planting added greatly to the beauty of the
place. Pennicuick mentions that, in an' old orchard near the
house, the herons built their nests upon some pear trees, which
were large and old trees in 1715. Armstrong, in 1775, sa s
that New Posse, formerly called Dalwick, “ srom being a lonely
mansion in the bosom of a gloomy mountain, is now the extreme
reverse. The wast improvements made by its present possessor
have proved not only an ornament to Tweeddale, but aworthy
example for emulation in the gentlemen of the county. The,
botanical and culinary gardens are justly esteemedt e most

“The name of New Poss0,'’ Dr. Pennicuick tells us, “was
given to the place by Sir James Nasmyth, grandson of the first
possessor of that name, who was sheriff·depute in 1627. The
late Sir James Nasmyth of Posso has extended and finished
the place, and numerous plantations, with as much teste and
elegance as the Dutch mode of gardening by line and rule will
admit of. He likewise kept it in high order, and hythe su·
