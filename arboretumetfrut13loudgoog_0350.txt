, himself and his seat the models for imitation to the country
where he lived. To have every thing about themselves and their
houses as like to James Nasmyth and New Posso as possible
was then the height 01 their ambition, about 1775, among the
gentry 01 Tweeddale. A very well written letter, by this Sir
J. Nasmyth, on the subject 01 botany, in answer to one from His
Lordship at Blair Drummond, is preserved in Lord Wood-
houselee's [ψ ry'Lord Kaimr, and in compliment to him the
birch called the Betula Nasmythii was so named. Many 01 the
fine trees about New Posso have been lately cut down and sold,
besides all those at Posso.” The above is extracted 11010 Dr.
Pennycuick's Worts in Prose aad Verre, which were originally
published 1111715, bat 01 which an edition was published in
1814, with notes up to that year. New Posso is at present
distinguished 101 its plne and larch plantations; and, according
to Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, the first larches introduced into
Scotland were planted at Dawick in the year 1725 (Lauder's
Gilpin's bbrest Scenery, vol. i. p. 148.); though this is doubtful,
as will herealter appear. Sir Thomas also mentions a locust
tree at Dawick, which, at 311. from the ground, measures5 ft.
10 in. in girt. The present proprietor of Dawick, or New Posso,
is Sir John Nasmyth, grandson 01 the Sir James celebrated by
Dr. Pennicuick.

Holyrood House‚ where the Oriental plane was first planted
in Scotland, is, as every one knows, the royal palace 01 Edin-
burgh. The Abbey 01 Holyrood, according to Maitland (Hist.
pf 1111111), was founded by Kin David l., in 1128, and consisted
of a church and cloister. llaitland speaking 01 this church
end cloister, says:— “ After having stood 400 years in the
fields, by themselves, King James V., about the year 1528.
erected a house to reside in at his coming to Edinburgh,
near the south-western corner 01 the church, with a circular
tu'rret at each angle, which is the present tower at the north-
western corner 01 the palace3 to which was added, by King
Charles Il., in the year 1674, all the other parts 01 the present
llllllllhlllhl'isslll', nlltttllttssqltttt {t {tlt}
in this neighbourhood with a stonern wall, about three miles in
circumference, which probably is uo where to be paralleled ; for,
instead 01 trees and thickets 101 cover, which other parks abound
with, Icoulrl not, after the strictest search, discover one tree
therein: in lieu whereof, itis supplied with huge rocks and vast
tleclivities, which lornish the Edinburghers with the best 01
stones to pare their streets withal; as do the other parts 01 the
said park yield good pasturage, and meadow grounds, with con·

siderable spots 01 arable land.'' (Maitland’s Hist. ‘ff Edin,
