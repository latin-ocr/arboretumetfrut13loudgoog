fol. 1759, p. 159.) Amot, in his ΗίείοῃκῃΓ Ediraharglr, pub·
lished in 1779, speaking of this park, says: κ- “ In the memory
of people not long since dead [Amot wrote about 1779], the
level strip at the foot of the hill [Arthur's seat], which, from the
Duke of York having delighted to walk in it, bears the name of
⁶ The Duke’s Walk,' was covered with tall oaks3 but now there
is hardlya single tree in its whole boundaries. Indeed‚ it is
extremely doubtful if, except at the bottom, there ever were any
trees on these hills, the height of the ground and barrenness of
tbe soil being very unfavourable to their growth.'' (Arnot’s Hiar.
ofEds'n, tto, Edin, 1779, p. 309.) lt is clear, therefore, that the
platanus, mentioned by Dr. Walker, was not planted in the park
at Holyrood House: but we learn from the same authorities
(Maitland and Arnot) that there were two walled gardens
attached to the palace3 and that “the royal gardan at the
northern end ο1 the outer court ’' was “ converted into a physic
garden‚” and that it was under the same superintendence‚ and
{illd ttltttttttttttlt lhill⁰rl⁰ll0²¹¹fs¹l⁶ lttl
adjoining the palaea, that the platanus mentioned bly, Iylr. ll'alker
was planted; and the plantet was probably Sutherland.
Bargally is to ua by far the most interesting seat in Scotland,
with respect to the introduction of foreign trees and shrubs,
and though we have taken the greatest pains to ascertain from·
what circumstances its proprietor became so much attached to
botanical pursuits, as to introduce iu a remote paraof Scotland,
in the l7th century, trees then scarcely known even in its
metropolis, and have been in a great measure successful; yet
there is still some deficiency in the information we have ob·
tainod. Bargally is a small property situated in a glen, the sides
of which are covered with natural wood, between Gatehouse
in Kirkcudbri htshire and Newton·Stewart. The proprietor's
name was Andrew Heron ; and he appears, by a family tomb in
the grounds, to have died there in 1799. We have applied
to about a dozen different persons in Kirkcudbrightshire‚ whom
we deemed most likely to give us information respectlng Bar·
gally and its planter, and the following are extracta from the
communicatione we have received, joined to what we ,have been
ableto glean from books. One of our correspondents informs
us, “that Andrevr Heron was ason of Heron of Heron of
Kirauchtree (Caeruchtred), chief of that name. This Andvew
built a cottage‚ in which he resided, at the upper extremity
of the beautiful valley in which the present house of Bargally
stands, and planted all the lower part of the valley. The
splendid Quercus Plex and the noble beeches, which you saw
in 1881, are but miserable relies of the magnificent forest

which once roae between Bargally House and the river Palnure.
