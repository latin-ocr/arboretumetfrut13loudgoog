The only remaining known descendant of Heron of Bargally, in
the male line, is Captain Basil Heron of the Royal Artillery,

Andrew Heron corresponded with Bradley on gardenin
subjects; and from this correspondence it appears that he had
a carious water-cloch in his grounds, that he trained his
pear trees in a particular manner, and that he cultivated in
his fields what he calls the “ true Roman cytisus.’' (See Bradleffs
Treatr're ort Habandry and Gardeaiug‚ 1726, vol. ii. p. 169.)
Mr. Maxwell, writing about the same period to Mr. Hope
of Ranlreillor, says, “ l have of late been with Mr. Heron of

of the trees planted by Andrew Heron still in existence.
Having applied to the present proprietor, John Maclrie, Esq„
for the dimensions of some of these trees, the following is
an extract from his letter, dated Beth, March at. 1885:-
“ Ihave now received the measurement of some of the old trees
at Bargally, which is as follows, viat-the circumference of a
beech (usually denominated the large beeclr), at 18 in. from the
ground, is 18 ft, and ir is upwards of 90 ft. in height. This
tree is in the most perfect health, and when in full foliage is
truly magnificent. The circumference of an ever reen oak in
the gardan, at 14 in. from the ground, is rehendit is above
60 ll. high: this tree is also in a very thriving state, and does
not show the least tendency to decay. The circumference of a
