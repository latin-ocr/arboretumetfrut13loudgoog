Dr. Wallrer, in his Essays (p. 82), mentions several firs and
pines at Bergally, 01 large dimensione, which no longer exist. A
fir, he says, which was planted in 1697, measured, in 1780, 90 st.
⁸ in height. He states that the oldest and· largest arbor vitae in
Scotland was at Bargally: it measured, in 1780, 511. 4 in. in
girt at 4 ft. from the ground, and was 4011. hi h. He also
mentions a flowering ash (O‘rnus europoeb), which was cut

down in laudandust. 01 the trunlr guartered to make four

axles to carts3 it was a remarkably han some tree, 6 11 8 in. in

Wallrer mentions large evergreen oaks, horsechestnuts, and

many other species, 01 extraordinary dimensione. The present

We took notes ourselves (in 1831) 01 several remarkable
trees at Bargally, including a large lime tree and a number
01 beautiful variegated hollies from 2011102611. in height, and
with trunks from 15 in. to 211. iu diameter. Altogether the
place is one 01 very great interest, not only on account 01 ita
venerable foreign trees and the tomb 01 Heron, but from the
romantio beauty 01 the situation, and from the district in which
it lies bgiing one 01 the finest, in point 01 scenery, in the west of
Scotlan .
