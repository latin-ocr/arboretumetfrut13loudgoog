London‘in pot's in the year 1741. Sir Thomas Diclr Lauder,
as we have seen, however, says the larch was first planted in
Scotland, at Sir Janres Nasmytb's, at Dawiclr, in 1725. The
, Rev. James Headriclr, in hisSurvafy ‹ffForsarslrira gives another
account of the introduction of the larch into Scotland. He
says, “ It is generally supposed that larches were lirst brought
into Scotland by one of the Dulres of Athol; but l saw three
larches of extraordinary size and age, in the garden near the
mansion house of Lockhmt of Lee, on the northern banks of the
Clyde, a few miles below Lanark. The stems and branches
were so much covered with lichens, that they hardly exhibited
any si s of lile or vegetation. The account I heard of them
vaae, t at they were brought there by the celebrated Lochhart ot*
Lee (who had been ambassador from Cromwell to France), soon
aster the restoration of Charles II. (about 1660). Alter Crom-
nell's death, thinking himsell unsafe on account ol having served
a usurper, he retired some time into the territorias of Venice.
He there observed the great use the Venetians made of larches
in ship-building, in piles for buildings, iu the construction ol
their houses, and lor other purposes; and when he returned home
he brought a number os lar'ch plants in pots, with a view to try
if they could be gradually made to endure the climate ot* Scot-
land. He nursed his plante in hot-honses, and in a green-house
sheltered from the cold, until they all died, except the three
alluded tor these, in desperation, he planted in the warmest and
best sheltered partos his garden, where they attained an extra·
ordinary height and girth.'’ (Headriclr's Forfarsht're, p. 374.)
The estate of Dunkeld now contains the most extensive plant·
ationsol the larch in the island, spreading over several thousand
acres. A copious and most valuable account of tbese plantatione
will be fouutl in the Transactions pf tlte Highland Society, vol.
ix, and anabridgment of that account in our Eutyclopaedia aff
Gurdening, §657aedia183a Dunkeld has long been cele·
brated forits scenery. Dr. Clarke, the traveller, says, the scene
that opens before you, after going through the pass, perhaps has
not its parallel in Europe. “The grounds of the Duke of
Athol,'’ he continues, “1‘d0 not hesitate to pronounoe without
a rival.'’ Gray, the author of the Elegy, was ‘⁴ overcome and
almost lost” by the beauties of Dunkeld. Gilpin called it the
“portal ol the Highlands,'’ and Dr. Macculloch has nearly
filled a volume on the subject. The house at Dunkeld is a
plain large building, erected in 1685, but it has long been in
contemplation to remove it, and to build one ol' superior archi·
tectural protensione. John Murray, the present Duke of Athol,
has lately constructed a magnificent public bridge over the Tay

at Dunkeld, government assisting HisGrace with one sixth part
of tbe expense. The bridge was constructed on dry land, and
