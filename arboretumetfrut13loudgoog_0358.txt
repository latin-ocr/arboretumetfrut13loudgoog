Hopetoun House, the property 01 the Earl of Hopetoun, is
still celebrated forits cedars. According to a letter, dated No·
rember, 1834, which we received from Mr. 81111111, the gardener

Smith observes, that these cedar trees are the fastam-growing
trees on the estate. The largest, in 1834, 1100001011 nearly

It is observed by Dr. Walker, that most of the foregoing
trees were only planted 111 gardens and plemma-grounds 00
