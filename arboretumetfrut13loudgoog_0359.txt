house and gardana. The author of the treatise tells us that he
was “fond of dogsand horses, and had no manner of inclination
to plant, till he was obliged to form some enclosures for graaing
bistones, as he found the purchase of hay very expensive.''
Alter he began, his lady, who “ was a great lover of planting,

William Bruce‚ his father, and some others, he says, had planted
a great deal3 yet he adds, ‘⁶ Ι will be bold to say, that planting
vvas not well understood in this country till this century began.
Ithinlr it was the late Earl of Mar, that first introduced the
wilderness way of planting amongst us; and very much improved
the taste of our gentlemen‚ who very soon followed his example.”
(p. 3.) What the earl means bya wilderness, we afterwards
leam, is a plantation with straight wallis cut through it, in the
geometrical style of landscape·gardening; in England, a wilder-
nell< plantation is 'gengfassll understood to be one in which the

It does not dpfpear, from this treatise, that the earl planted
many trees of foreign origin in his woods ; but, from the dimen-
sions of some arbor vitaes, evergreen nelis, chestnuts‚ tito, there
can be little doubt that he did not lose sight of such trees in his
· omamental plantatione near the house. sang, in the Planter's
Kalmdor (adedit p. 551.)‚ mentions a silver fir as having been
planted in Binning Wood in 1705. This wood, he says, “re-
flects great honour on the memory of the lady who planted it;'’
meaning, no doubt, the Countess of Haddington above mentioned,

who is said to have sold herjewels‚ to enable her to plant Binnin
wood. The holly hedges at Tynin ham planted bv this estland

his successor are unquestionahly the finest in Bituin. Some
notices respecting these hedges are given in the Loudon Horti·
crdtarnl Societyls Transactima, vol. viii, and iu the Gardeners
Magozine, vol. ii. p. 184. There are in all 2952 yards of holly
hedge, in different lengths, of different heights of from 101025 u,
and of widths from 9 to 13 ft: they are, with the exception of

one, regularly clipped every April. The largest single olly at
Tyningham,according to the dimensionssent usiuJanuary‚1885,
was 1211. high. The hedges were for the most part planted in
1712. Wight of Ormiston, in his Genera Suroey of the Agri·
culture (ff Scotlond, speaking of Tyningham in 1768, says, these
hedges, and the abundance of evergreens, give the place the

in Scotland, according to Dr. Wallrer, was Archibald Dulce of
Argyll; unquestionably, also, as we have seen (p. at), the great·

communicated this teste to a number of his intimate friends,
