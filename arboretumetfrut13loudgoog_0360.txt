both 111 England and Sootland. Among these, 111 the latter
country, Dr. Walker mentions tbe Dulre of Athol, the Earls of
Bute, of Loudon, of Hyudford, and of Panrnure3 SirJanres
Nasmyth, Mr. Fletcher of Saltoun, Sir Archibald Grant, and
others. By the exertions of these gentlemen, planting became
very general in Sootlaud between the years 1130 and 1760.
(Walters Hebrides, vol. i. p. 110.)

Sir Archibald Grant began 10 plant in 1719. The following
is 011 extract taken from a commonplace book kept by this
gentleman, and published in the Gordmer's regmae, vol. xi.
p. 48. : - “ 1111715,” Sir Archibald says, ‘⁴ by the indulgence of
a very worthy father, l was allowed, though then very young, to
hegin to 0001000 and plaut, and provide and prepare nurseries.
At that time there vus not 000 0010 00 the whole 001010 enclosed,
111111 ltlhll'ltl 11111111111111111111 llil}
gling trees 01 00010 01 the farmyards, with a small copsevood,
not enclosed, and dwarlish, and browsed by sheep and cattle.”

It is probable that most of the foreign trees and shrubs that
were introduced into Scotland previously to the middle 01 the 18111
century, vere raised from seeds in the different 1000111101. There
could have been few, if any, public 1100 1101001100 10 Scotlaud
previously to that peri0d3 and the carrlage of trees from Eng-
land must have been extremely 101110000011 expensive. The
Eerl 01 Haddington was, in all probability, the originator 01
1101001100 10 Scotland, as well as the father 01 0111110101 plant·
ations iu that country, 011 0 large scale 101 profit John Reid,
the author 01 the Scots 6011111111, published in 1683, mentions
Hugh Wood, gardener at Hamilton, dealing 10 11011 trees and
numerous other garden articles, whether English, Dutch, 01
Scotch, buthe makes no mention 01 101001 trees. Sutherland’s
Hortus Medicus Edinburgensir, published in 1683, 10 stated in
the title to be sold by “ Mr. Henry Ferguson, seed rner-
01100101 0 head 01 Black Triar’s Wynd.’' That there were
010010, trees, 810, sold hythe gardeners in Scotland, is ob·
vinus from the following advertisement, dated 17111-’1 There 10

Improvers 01 Agriculture in Scotlend in 17131 and, the Society
having been established in 1713, this firm, now Eagle and
Henderson, may date from the latter period. They had, how-
ever, no nursery fot· at least half a century afterwards. Dr.
Walker seems to indicate that public nurseries for forest trees

began to be established in Sootlaud between the years 11100011
