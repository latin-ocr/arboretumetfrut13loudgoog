1760. The most considerable 01 these, he says, was that 01 old
Mr.Diclrson, atHassendeanburn, in Teviotdale. This nursery, we
are informed by the present proprietors, Messrs. Archibald Diclr-
son and Co, was founded in 1719. From it spran , in 1767,
the nursery 01 Messrs. Dickson‚ now Dickson and urnbull, at
Perth3 and, subsequently, another brother 01 the Hasaendeanburn
famil ‚ Walter Dickson‚ began the house 01 Dickson and Co. 01
Edinhnrgh now Dicksons and Shankley, in connexion with Mr.
JsmesDickson, who was no relative 01 the family. It thus appears,
that Mr. Rnbert Dickson 01 Hassendeanbum was the father 01
commercial forest trae nurseries in Scotland. The three nurseries
established b him and his two brothers being still the most
extensive in that country. Mr. Archibald Dickson‚ the present
chief 01 the firm at Hassendeanburn and at Hawick, to whom
we are indebted 101 the above information, states, in his letter 01
March at. 1835, 1111 he is now bringing up some 01 the fifth

were those 01 Μ1. Richmond 01 Leith Wallr, 01 Gordenoi

Austen 01 Glasgow, 01 Thenas Leslie and Co. 01 Dundee,
of Reid of Aberdeen, 01 Sampson 01 Κ11111110001, and a
number 01 others. The most scientific nuraeryman in scotland,
during the 18th century, appears 10 have been Mr. Boutcher.
According to an authority quoted by Sir Henry Stenart, Mr.
Boutcher was “ the honestest and most judicious nurseryman
Scotland ever had? He made an attempt to improve Scottish
arboriculture about 1760; but, according to Sir Henry, he was
‘⁶ undervalued by the ignorance os his age, and suffered to
languish unsupportetl for years at Comely Garden‚ and 10 dieat
last in obscurity and indigencc.” (Planter's Guide, ad edit.
p. 999.) Boutcher’s 11101111 on raising Forest Trees was the
first work on the subject of its time, and Scottish nurserymen
have only produced one work on planting superior to it 3 namely,
the edition of Nicol’s Ponam Kalendar, which was edited, and
in great part rewritten‚ by Mr. Sang of Kirkaldy.

Tae indigenam trees os Ireluad are the same as those 01
Britain, though such as consider the box, the true service, and
the common English elm, truly indigenous to England will not
accord with this, as these trees are never sound in an apparently
wild state in lreland. Those, on the contrary, who consider
the A'rbutus and Erico mediterrhnea indigenous 10 Ireland
find them wanting in England, and may hence consider that
Ireland has more native trees and shrubs than this country.
