are frequently dog up from bogs. Mr. Mackay has sent us an
account received by him from Mr. Charles Hamilton‚ Houorary
Secretary to the Horticultural Society 01 lreland‚ 01000 dn
up in Queen’s County, the rings 01 annual increase 01 which
indicated a growth 01 545 years. The greatest diameter 01
1110 trunk 01 this tree was only 19101 The growth appeared
to be very slow during the last 300 years, 101 near the cir-
cumference there were about 100 rings within the space 01
an inch. The root and bark were quite sound, and the stem
from which the section was taken was about 12 ft. long, and
01 tolerably even thickness throughout. Mr. Mackay says that
he2saw a yew trae in the lslan 01 10011111100, 00 the lower
lake 01 Killarney, which must have been as old as 111110100-
tioned by Mr. Hamilton; and which, when he mensurerl 11 about
thirty years ago, was nearly double the dimensions. lf the lrish
yew be a distinct species, lreland may claim this fine tree as her
own. Our own opinion is, that this yew is nothing 111010 than
a variety 01 the common species. The largest specimens 01 this
trec, 111οΤ111110 hibernica 01 Maclray, ure in egerden attha
village 01 01101101, 0011 Belfast: they are about 2'5 11. 10 height,
aud have, at a distance, the appearance 01 cypressos. They
are supposed to have been plunud about 50 years, but their
history is unknown.

From information procured 101 us through the kindness
01 Lord Viscount Ferrard, we lind that there is an upright or
Irish yew in a gardan at Mayland, near Antrim, 180 years old,
1511. high; the diameter 01 1110 space covered by the branches,
lolt.; and the diameter 01 the trunk close to the ground, 311.
This tree, and three others in the town, are supposed to have
been planted by the Refords, when they first settled in Mayland
in 1712. ‘⁶ An upright yew, probably the parent 01 the above
trees, and 01 all others in this country, grew in Mr. Ferguson's

rden. lt was cut down about 1601 17 years ago, by the late Mr.
11801111ος and his son, now in Antrim, has several pieces 01111101-
ture which were made lrom 11. 10 1110 panel 1 11. broad, 01 000
01 these a wardrobe, l can count about 100 annual concentn'c
layers, and as the tree, it is said, was 2st. in diameter, this would
gire 000 years, and 40 01 50 years 10010 might probaby be added
for the time when scarcely any enlnrgenrent took place.”··-

If the arbutus be not indigenons to lreland‚ 11 is at least
completely naturalisetl there, being found, as the yewis in
England, in places completely inaccessible to a plantet, and
where the sceda must have been carried by birds. One 01 1110
largest specimens stood in Rough Island, on the lower lake 01
Killarney, 10 1805 ; 11 was measured in that year by Mr. Mackay,
and the trunk found, at 1100111001 1110 ground, to be 9111. ‚in
