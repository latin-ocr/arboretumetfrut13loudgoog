larch and silver fir. From a considerable number, of almost
e ual magnitude, measured for us by desire of Lord Roden‚ we ·
edent one silver fin-planted 60 years ago, which is 8411. high 3
the diameter, 11 1 11. from the ground, 511 21111 11 10 11., 411.;
and 11 24 11., att 3111.; itis beautifully and cvenly clothed with
branches, the lower tiers of which are pendent to the ground,
and the circumfereoce of the space which they coveris 160 st.
The larch of Tollymore Park is in much estimation forits
tenacity‚ and it supplies masts of froin 50 11 to 6011. in length.
As a selection from a great number, we take one tree, which, at
80 years of age, is 8411. high 3 the diameter, at 1 st. from the
ground, 211 8 in.; and 10 ft from the ground, 211. 3 in.;
another trec, at 60 years of age, is 6611. high; the diameter,
111 ft from the ground, being 8 11.; and 111011,1 2113111.
Among numerous fine specimens of shrubs introduced by' the
late Lord Clanbrassill, there is a Rhododendron phnticum, which,
nt 50 years ο1 age, is 1011. high, and covers, with its unbroheu¹
111111 of foliage, a space the circumferente of which is 90 ft.
The larch at Tollymore Parlr is grown on the side of a steep
hill facing the north, on 1 11111 gravelly substratum, which corre·
sponds with the natural situation in which the larch is found in
Switaerland, as stated by Deoarrdolle,intheQ1merluJounmloy”
Agriadtrtre, 1ο1.ν. p. 408.; and with 1111 situations in th'e neigh-
bourhood of Dunkeld, where the best larch is grown by the
Duke of Athol, as stated in the account of these plantations
in the transactum (ff the Highfand Society ⁰f 8111111111, 1ο1. 111.
p. 165. to p. 219. Mouteath, the Sootch forester, we are informed
b Lord Roden‚ and also by another correspondent, considers the

ollytnore larch 11 very superior in quality to the generality of
the Sootch or Welch larch. Lord Roden states 11111 he uses it
for 111 purposes whatever, and that for forming utensils it is
found an excellent substitute for ash. The trees are generally
felled ut the age otto years. Tlre rhododendrons are scattered
through the woods; they are found fully as hardy 11 the conr-
mon laurel, and many of thern have attained a large size. There
are many specimens of Abies 11111111 111. Clanbrassillidna, but
none of thern remarkable.

At Dundalk, also the property of the Euri of Roden‚ there is
a Magnblia acumindta 2111. high; the circumference of the
stem, at l ft. fronr the ground, is 5ft.; aud at 311110111111
ground, 111. 6in.; and the brunches covers space measuring
8411. in circumference. There isan oak in the park 60 11. high;
the circumference of the trunk, at l 11. from the ground, 1115 ft.;
