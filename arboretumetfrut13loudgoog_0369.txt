The largest old oak tree in Ireland, Sir Robert Bateson in·
forms us, is athis residence, Belvoir Park, near Bellast. It
mensures about 28 ft. in girt at 6ft. from the ground; but it is
split, and much daura ed. Itis supposed to be between two and
three centurias old. lt grows about 50 yards from the banlrs of
the river Lagan, in rather mnist soil.

At Hillsborough, the seat ol the Marquess of Downshire, in
Lady Downshire's gardan, a tulip tree carries up the gir-t of
alt 6 in. to the height of 8 lh, when it branches off. lt flowers
abundantly, and bas flowered for many ears past. Close to
this trec is a Magnblz'a acuminata 25 ft. high, and lit. lin. in
girt at 277. lrom the ground, where it branches3 it does not
flower every year, but in hot summers very abundantly. There
is, also, a cedar 8lt. 8in. in circumference at alst. from the
ground, where it begins to branch. It is not tall, and is quite
llat at the top. There are several other forest trees, and some
shrubs of about the same age, or perhaps older, in the grounds,
particularly sorne very line evergreen oalrs. -J. M. R.

No Dr. Wallrer has yet arisen in Ireland to determine the dates
ol the introduction ol particular species, and all that we have been
able to do, therefore, is to place before our readers the sore-

dinary rapidity of the growth of the trees that have been planted.
There are also the greatest inducements, in point of climate, as
will appear in our succeeding subsection, when we ive a list of
what are green-house trees and shrubs in England, but which
stand the open air in Ireland.

Nurseries vvere probably established in Ireland about the
tirne when it became sashionable to plant trees. The oldest we
know of is that ol' Toole and Co. at Cullenawood near Dublin‚
and at Shanlr Hill near Bray. In both gardana are sorne very
fine specimens of foreign trees and shrubs. At Cullenswood,
Magnhlin grandiflhra has attained the height of 17 ft. in 20
years, and M. Thornpsonidnc, 15ft. in 6 years; A‘rbutus Au·
drachne, and A. hybrida, 19 st. in 27 years; Olea excelsa, asa
standard, 17 ft. in 27 years; Pittbsporum Tabira, as a standard,
10 ft. in 20 years; chca glorihsa, 8ft. in 80 years, with astera

a foot in diameter; Ardlia spinhsa‚ 20 ft. in 20 years; Eriobb-
trya japbnica, 20 a. in 20 years; P¹rus [Sorbus] nipalbnsis, 16 st.
in 7 years; Laurus nbbilis, 25 in 85 years; and Poebnr'a
Mortua, ah. in 20 years. ln the Shank Hill Nursery there is an
A‘rbutus Andrachne, 2ο ft. high, with a head oovering a space
80 yards in circumference, 80 years old.
