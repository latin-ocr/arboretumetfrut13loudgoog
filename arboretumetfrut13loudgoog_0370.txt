116 HISTOBY ΛΝΒ GEOGRAPHY OF TREES· PABT 1.

The nursery of Mr. Hodgins at Dunganstown, near Wicklow,
was established about 1780, and was well stocked with foreign
trees and shrubs. Mr. Niven lrindly measured some of the
largest of these for us in February, 1885, and a copious list has
been sent to us by the proprietor, Mr. Hodgins, through Mr.
Maclray. The Cupressus lusitanice in this nursery, 54 years
planted, is 2010 high, with a trunk, at l ft. from the ground,
fist. in girt‚ and the branches covering a space the circumference
of which is upwards of 120 ft. This is probably the [inest in
lreland, next to Lord F errard's, mentioned p. 109. There is
a hedge of evergreen oalrs in this nursery 50 ft. high. There
are several large silver firs, with trunks which girt 6st. and 7ft.,
which have grown to the height of 60 ft.; red cedars 20 0., and
laurels and bays 30 ft. high; there is a Lucombe oak 50 ft.
high, with a trunk 18 in. in diameter at 10 ft. from the ground3
the cedar of Lebanon, 45 years planted, is from 30 ft. to 35 ft.
high; the Portugal laurel 10300. high ; the timber of tbis
trec, Mr. Hodgins observes, is better than that of the cherry.
There are many pines from 200. to 30 ft. high; aristotelias,
20 ft. high; Olea excelsa, 120. high; Norway maple‚ the
wood of which, Mr. Hodgins observes, is as hard as box; and
the sugar maple, growing as vigorously as the common syca-
more. All these trees, and many others, were planted by the
present proprietor, who, Mr. Niveu informs ua, is a most enthu-
siastic and successful cultivator, who has done, perhaps, more in
Ireland, in the way of cultivating rare trees and shrubs, than any
other contemporary; and who, though of an advaneed age, is
still healtby and vigorous, and derives the greatest enjoyment
from the exercise of his profession.

The nursery of Mr. Robertson, at Kilkenny, was founded by ,

100 father of the present proprietor about 1765, who introduced
most of the foreign trees and shrubs cultivated about that time
in the London nurseries. Though most of these were used aa
stools for propagation, yet a few of them have been allowed to
run up as specimens. Among these is aCorylus Colurna, which,
at 50 years'growth, is 3 ft. 7 in. in girt at l ft. from the ground3
it is 25 ft. high, and the diameter of its head is nearly 50ft.
Besides this, annitentes glandulhsa, aJudas tree, and several
others, are worthy of notice3 the details of which will he found
in the Gard. Mag, vol. xi. p. 210. Most of the other nurseries
in lreland were founded, we believe, in the succeeding century.
The establishment ofa Botanic Garden at Glasnevin must
have given a considerable stimulus to the introduction of foreign
trees and shrubs into lreland. This gardan owes its origin, in
1797, to the late Lord Oriel. The plau of the gardan, Mr.
Mackay informs us, “ was also suggested by His Lordship, but
the laying out and arrangement were the work of Mr. Under-
