the largest 40 ft. high, with a trunk 2 11. 111 diameter at l ft from
the ground, which are probably the best to be met with in
Britain or lreland. What is remarkable in British nurseries,
though common in French ones, there isa Pinus cambra, which
was grafted 011 a Scotch pine about 20 years ago, and now
forms a fine tree. The garden contains 80 statute acres3 it

Suasacr. 5. Ostha Foreign Trees and Shrubs introduced into Brr'tor'n

siderably increased among planters3 and the number 01 new
species and varieties that have been introduced, is proportionately
greater than at any former period. Botanic gardens end arbo-

duced into shrubberies and ornamental plantatione, though still
not so great as it might be, bears some relation to the neral
improvement. The establishment of the Horticultural ciety

For this reason we shall limit ourselves to givin ashort com·
parative view 01 the species of trees and shrubs which have been
introduced, and a slight notice 01 the principal arboretums which
have been formed3 taking, as our authority for the date of the
introduction ol' the trees and shrubs, our Hortus Britanniae.

ln the first decade of the nineteenth century, viz, from 1801
10 1810 inclusive, ninety·four trees and shrubs were introduced:
