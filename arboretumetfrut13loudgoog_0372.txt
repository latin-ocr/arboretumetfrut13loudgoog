what remarkable, that os such anumber of species introduced
during this decade, the names ol so few of the introducers should
be lrnown3 but it must be recollected that the means of intro-
ducing were, atthis period, principally by packets of seeds sent
1ο the nurserymen by foreign correspondents, or by amateurs3
and that, as several years must necessarily elapse between the
period of introduction, and that of flowering and naming, the
name of the collector who sent the seeds, or of the nurseryman
who first raised plante from them, is sorgotten, or censes to be ol
the same interest. The case is different when living planta are
brought into the country, and itis, in truth, chielly of the intro-
ducers ol such that the names are known.
