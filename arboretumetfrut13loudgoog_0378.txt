Society, is, perhaps, the largest of the whole. One of these,
which had been blowndown, messured 215 ft. in le h, end
57 fes in. in circumference, ot 3 st. from the groun . The
eones of it, which Mr. Dougles sent home, were 16 in. long, and
il in. in circumference. The hernel of the seed ie sweet end
pleasant to the taste, end is eaten by the Indians, either roested,
or pounded into course cates for winter store. The resin, which
exudes from the trees when they are partly burned, loses its
usual flavour, and acquires n sweet tester in which state it is
used hythe nativea es sugar. Another species, nomed by Mr.
Sabine rfhies Dougldsir', attains nearly the size of the above.

In the spring of 1827 Mr. Douglus traversed the country
from Fort Vencouver, across the Roc y Mountains, to Hudson’s
Bay, where he met Copteiu (now sir) John Frenklin, Dr.
Richardson, and Cnptuin Beck, returning from their second
overland arctic expedition. With these gentlemen he cerne to
En land in the autumn, bringing with him a variety of seeds, as
welias specimens of plants and other objects of natural history.
Through the kindness of his friend and petron Mr. Sabine, he
was introduced to the notice of men of the leading literery ond
scientific characters in London3 end shortly afterwards he was
honoured by being elected, free of expense, e Fellow of the
Linnoean, Geological, end Zoologicul Societies3 to euch of
which' he contributed several papers, since published in their
Transactions, evincIng much resenrch and ecuteness os e natu-
ralist. Some entertaining extracts from his letters to Dr. Hooker
were published in Bretoster's Edirtburglt Journal for Jenuary,
18273 und egenus of plante belonging to the natural order
Primultoeae was dedicated to him by Professor Lindley, und
defined in Brunde’s Jounmt for dunuary, 1828.

Aller bein in London for two years, Mr. Donglas again
sailed for Codumbia in the autumn of 18293 where he re-
mmned some time, en'oying his favourite pursuit, end adding
lergely to his former discoveries. His return was expected by
the very ship which brought the tidings of his horribledeeth;
un event which was occasioned hy his falling into a pit made

by the nativos of the Sendwich Island's for catching wild bulls,
one of the letter being in at the timo.

The plants introduced by Mr. Douglus are supposed to be
more numerous than those introduced by any other individual
whatever3 end what greatly adds to their velue is, thot, being

from a temperate region, they will all endure the open nir in this
country. he number of erbeceous species which he intro·
duced amounts to nearly 100, end of trees and shrnbs to 50.
The names of the latter compose the following list, which hos
been kindly communicated to us by Mr. Munro, the head gar·
dener of the London Horticultuml Society.
