Of the above specimens‚ which were alt introduced by seeds, the
three marked with a ⁴⁸ did not vegetare. Sorne species of unse
and Cratae⁸gus, not included in the above list, have vegetated,
but are not enumereted, as they have not yet flowered; and
consequently have not yet been named or identified.

To enable our readers to take a general view of the various
details respecting introductione given in the preceding nages, we
shall next endeavour to generalise themr first, numerically3 and,
secondly, geographically. For the first object, we have had
from our Hortus Britannicus an enumeration made of the nunr-
ber of species introduced in each decade, from the beginning oi
the loth century to the end of the year 1880. We do not give
this enumeration aa periectly accurator because man of the
species in our catalogue, as in every other, are doubtfui3 but it
is not of rnuch consequence whether it be persectly accurata or
notr it is sufficiently so to show the ratio ot' the increase of the
introductione, frorn the earliest periods of which we have any
record of them, up to the present time.

*Laurus occidentalis.
Pinus Lambertidna.
