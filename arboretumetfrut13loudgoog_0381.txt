ornamental trees aad shrubs are from North America. Our
greatest hopes lor future introductioas are from the unpene·
noted regions ol' North Ameriae, and the mountninous regions
ol Asia and New Zealand. ’

We shall conclude this chapter by enumerating some of the
principal planters of arboretums, and places where arboretums
were planted, during the present centuryt premising that we do
not include in this list any of those places which were com·
menced during the last century.

Among the planters of arboremms in Great Britain during
the oineteenth century, the first place belongs to Georgo,
fourth dolie of Marlborough. This nobleman, when Mar·

. in 1817. About 1801 he began to collect plante ol every de·
scription, built nanierous hot-houset sor the exotica, and occu·
pierl a large walled gardea with the hardy herbaceous plante,
and the more choico trees and shrubs. Soon alter, finding this
garden too limited, he employed, as an arboretum, a space of
several acres, called the Wood, and throughout the parlr at
White Knights he distributed many trees, and a collection, us
extensive as could be then procured, of the genus Crataegus.
About this time magnolias, rhododendrons, aznleas, aad other
American trees and shrubs, being rare, or newly introduced,
bore enormously high prices; but price was never taken into
consideration hythe Marquess of Blandiord. He was never coa-
tent with only one plant oi' a rare species, if two or more could

formed ua, that he had sold several planta ol the seme species to
the marquess when they were at twenty guineas, and even thirty
' guineas each. In consequence ol a similar mode of proceeding
in h·- transactions generally, the Marquess of Blandiord soon
found himself involved in deht and lawsuits, which, since 1816,
have greatly crippled his exertions. He has still, however, the
same toste for plante, and indulges it, as lar as his limited re·
sources will permit, in the pleneme-grounds of the palace at
Blenheim, where His Grace at present resides. erite Knights
is now chiefly remarkable for its magnalia wall, which is 145 ft.
long and 2411. hi h, entirely covered with twenty-two plants of
Magnhlia grandihbra, which flower every year frorn June till
November. They were planted in the year 1800, when the
price in the nursern'es, for good plante, was five guineas each. In
the Wood there are a great number of remarkably line speci·
mens of all the species os Magnhlia, and especially of M. auri·
culdta aad acuminata. There are also very line trees of Acer
rtlhrum, saccharinum, and striatam of AEsculus and Para, of
