Gleditschia, cercis, Crataegus, and Photinia 151t.high; some
of the finest trees of Pyros nivalis and bollwylleridna in the
country; of Halesia, Diospyros, Nyssa, Gymnocladus, Placere,
Jdglans, Studrtia, Laurus, Quercus, Juniperus, Thdja,aren1ark·
ably fine Cunninghamia, and many pines, among which are
the greatest number of Pinus Pallasidna to be found together
in any grounds in England. Pinus Cimbra has here attained the
height of 30 ft in 35 years3 and Liria pendula that of 50 ft in
the same time. At Blenheim the duke hns introduced the finest
trees he could procure, in numbers and in messes, as far as he
was enabled to do so; and Magnblia conspicua, of which seldoni
more than one or two plants are to be found in any one demesne,
may be there reckoned by dozens. An account of White Knights,
as far as its picturesque beauty extends. vill be found in Hoff-
lands's Descrz'ptim <ff White Knights, Lond. 1819, fol.; and of
its gardens, in a botanical and horticultural point of view, in the
Gardcner's Magazine, vol. ix. p. 664.; in which work will also
be found an account of Blenheim, vol. x. p. 99. The Duke of
Marlborough's gardener, from the commencement of the duhe's
gardening operatione at White Knights to the present time, has
been Mr. Jones. White Knights, which is now the property of
Francis Cholmeley, Esq, has its gardens under the direction of
Mr. Ward. The house is at present (1885) unoccupied.

William Beckford, Esq.‚ of Fonthill Abbey, began to plant at
that place all the rare trees and shrubs which he could procum,
about the sanie time as the Duke of Marlborough planted
White Knights. He pald no attention to house or to herbaceous
plants, but, like the duke, he planted the choicest trees and
shrubs, in quantitieS, without any regard to their cost; paying
for them, we believe, in ready money. We had the satisfaction
of inspecting the grounds at Fonthill twice in 1806, when they
were in their hi hest beauty and heeping3 and we spent twulays
in looking at ffnem again in 1833, when they were in a state of

were almost obliterated by the growth of common trees and
shrubs. There are still some fine magnolias, rhododendrons,
and azaleas in the American ground, which haue been hardy
enough to cope with the native trees which have been planted,
or have sprung up fortuitously around them. The scenery of
Fonthill has somewhat of a Swiss character, from the hilly ridge
on which the Abbey is built, and the prevalence of the pine and
fir tribe inshe woods; and in it there is an air of melancholy
grandeur, unlike that of any other place that we are acquainted
within Britain. A description of F onthill Abbey, when in its
most perfect state, has been given by Britton‚ in his Wltshire,
and a notice of it, as it appeared to us in 1833, will be found in
the Gard. Mag, vol. xi. p. 425.
