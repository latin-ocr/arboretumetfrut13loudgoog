ofall thetrees and shrubs,to the scale of a quarter of an inch 10
a font. Aa the object of Messrs. Loddiges was to include iu one
place, 001 only specimens 01 each particular tree and shrub, but
also stools for propagating them, aud a stock 01 young plants for
sale, all placed beside the specimen plant, it became necessary
to cut down the specimens as soon as they had attained a certain
siae3 and this was accordingly done with many 01 the timber trees
in 18880001 1888. Το us this has been an incalculable loss,
because it has preveuted us from examining many of the trees 10
llower3 but the stools or young plants still remain, and the col-
lection is increasing every year. So spirited an undertakiu

cannot be sufficieutly appreciated3 and it is only to be regretted
that the want of a separate piace of round sor containing the
stools and the plants for sale, rendered necessary the felling of a
collection of specimens such as could be found assemhled toge-
ther nowhere else iu the world. Some account of this arboretam,
accompanied bya plau, will he found in the Encyclopaedia of
Gardening, edit. 01 1885, p. 1217. Such a magnificent example
could not be expected to he generally followed by commercial
men, but it has rendered more frequent the practice among nur·
serymen of planting 001 specimens of choice trees and 010011ος
and some bave subsequently even formed regular arboretums.
Among these the first in the order of time, as well 00100001-
pleteness‚ is 1110101 Mr. Donald of the Goldworth Nursery, near
Woking, iu Surrey, which was commenced 101881, and of
which an account, with a plau, will be found in the Gurd. Mag,
volvii. p. 360. Τ1110 arboretum, which we viewed in May,
1884, already contains a number 01 very fine specimens. Mr.
Buchanan, jun„ of Camberwell, has spared 00 palus in collecting
trees and shruhs; aud had got together, 10 last, though in a
limited space, acollection which may ranlr next to that of Mr.
Donald. Mr. Miller of the Bristol Nursery has also planted 00
arboretum; and anursery has been formed hy Messrs.Young aud
Penny, at Milford, connected with the arboretam 01 Philip Barker
Wehb, Esq, which Messrs. Young and Peuny are greatl in·
creasing every year, hythe addition of new species. his
arboretum contains a great number of oaks, acers, and pines·
Mr. Rogers 01 Soutbampton began an arboretum in 18333 and
Mr. Page of the same place is also forming one. More or less
has been done in this way, 10 1110 nurseries 01 Μο0010. Lae of
