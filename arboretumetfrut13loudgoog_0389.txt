If we add ιο the indigenous woody plante 01 Frauee those which are culti-
vated or doubtful, the total ligneous flora 01 that countr will be above 580.
11 ιο this number we add the 528 trees and shrubs 01 οιι1ι Arnerica (see
p. lae), all of which will grow in France, it will give a total ligneous flora to
that country 01 above 1100 species ; which, considering that France possessas

woody planta 01 France‚ we have, as in the case of the enumeration of the
woody plants of the British lslands (p.27.), included all thc under-shrubs, ,
andalao all those reputed species which we believe to be mere varicties. We
have included the under-shrubs, because it is difficult to draw a line of sepa-
ration between those which might practically be considered as herbaceous
plante, though botanically they are suffruticose3 and because, in a state 01
culture, some 01 these suffruticose planta attain such ample dimensione,

¹ and such aligneous texture, as to assume quite a shrubby character ; for ex-

ample, Euphorbia Charicles in Britain stata), and Iberis saxdtilis in France

in dry deep garden ground the euphorbia will, in the course of a few years,
form a bush between ast. and sir. high; and the iberis a mass above half
that height. We have inserted the names of what we considet only varieties,
because we have no doubt thar, in most cases, they are plante tolerably dis·
tinet ; because it is impossible ιο be quite certain of what are species and what
varieties, without comparing them ιιι different s es of their growth, and
grown in the same soil, situation, and climate; an because we do not wish
ιο set up our own opinion in this matter as absolute.

In ιιι article by Professor Thouin, published in the Μ’έιιιοίιιι a'Agn'celtare
for the year 1786, it is stated that France thcn possessed about 84 different
specics of trees, 01 which 24 were 01 the first rank in point 01 siae, or ex-
ceeding 100 ft. in height; 16 01 the second rank, or excecdingdss 11. in height,
and the remainder of the third rank, orcxcceding30 ft. in height. The names
of these trees, and their arrangement according to the heights they ιιιιίιι, will
be found in the work last quoted, and also ιιι the Nouerca Ccars Conrplet
d'Agrr'culture, edit. 1821, ιιι. Arbae. Deleuze states that France contains
about 250 species of trees, of which more than three fourths are of foreign
origin. (Annales du Musc'unr, tom. iii. p. 191.)

Ample as is the ligneous flora of France, it might be doubled by adding to
it thc trees and shrubs 01 Australis, of the mountainous regions of Asia, and
of Mexico, Chili, and Peru. We do not speak 01 the whole 01 the trees end
shrubs 01 these countrics, because the schole are not yet known, but only 01
those tbat have been alread introduced into Britain, and are treated by us as
green-house plant ; all 01 wli
provinces 01 France. Were the total number 01 ligneous specics from these
countrics introduced, the number of trees and shrubs now in Frence would,
in all probability, be quadrupled.

But though the ligneous flora 01 Franco is so much more extensive than
that 01 Britain, yet it is far from being so equally spread over the country.

former. We essert this from a comparison between a liat 01 the trees and
shrubs now (1835 growimr in the Jardin der Plantas at Paris, hirnished to
us by Professor irbel, and the list which we have seen in MS. 01 the trees
and shrubs now in the gardan of the Horticulturel Society of London. No
