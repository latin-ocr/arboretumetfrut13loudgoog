Du Haruel, in the preface to his work, says that he has treated of shrube
as well as trees, in order 00 lead to the pursnit of the useful through the
medium of the reeable. “ There 10 reason,” heesys, “to hope that we shall
00 better listene tob the rich, when we propone to ornament their mansione
with fore' trees, 001 their urks with thickets of flowering shrubs, 0000 11 we
were simp y 00 0011 them to 0100 plantatione ou lande uniit for producing coru
or grass. If the aelf-love of the ssessors of country seats is liuttered hythe
view of common parke, notwi standing the revoltiu uniformity of their
thickets, which are only varied 00010001οἱ0 aize or in form, is there not rea·

ighly tified when 000 thicketa iu
these parks offer that variety which is produc by different kinds of trees
and shrubs, and which exhibita beauties suited to every seaeon 1” After giving
directions for choosing flowering trees aud sbrubs to form thickets for the
early part of spring, for the middle of spring, and for summer, he next shows
the superior enjoyment to be derived from the culture of trees, to that which
can be derived from the culture 01 herbaceous plaute. “ The most beautiful
bed of hyacinthe or tulips, when the flowers have once faded, leaves nothing
but what ia withered aud unsightly; whilst the flowers 01 trees aud shrubs
which generally appear iu spring are succeeded by the most vivid green laureas
000 even in winter, aster these rave drop ed, the ramification of the branches
000 sprsy is beautiful and interesting.” 10000000. xviii.)

Du Haruel remarks 0000 000 greatest difficulty which opposed itself 00 his
pla'n 01 renderin foreign trees arrd ahrubs eneral in France was, that the
{ester part of 00000 were not to be found for sale in the public nurseries,

r

son to hope 0000 they will be much more

om this we may conclude 0000 those who did introduce foreign trees aud
shrubs into France, during the 1800 century, received them chiefly from abroad.

Of this, indeed, there can be 00 doubt, since it is attested bya iving witness,
Mr. Thomas Blaikie, already mentioned, who ie 0 native of Scotland, 000 000
been settled in France aa 0 landscape-gardener since the year 1776. 10 the
Encyclopadio os Gardeuing, edit. 1835, p. 88, will he found 0 list 01 gardent
and grounds laid out by Mr.Blaikie in France between 1770 000 1794, iu
which he mentions that for one place (Metaon) he “ went to Eugland to huy
the trees and shrubs ; 'aa' at that time few trees or shrubs could be found in
01000οῐ0,00000010οξ00, 01 tlt ‘tlt‘ltlt‘tltult
were all procured from the Hammersmith Nursery.

’100 culture of foreign trees aud shrubs in French nurseries appears to have
commenced about the beginning of the present century, and the princi 01 nur-
serymen who engaged in that branch were M. Noieette, whose farier was
gmdeuer to Monsieur, afterwards Louie xvnr, 00 Brunoy,¹ and M. Cels,
who is now dead, and whose nursery is carried on by his son. On this sub-
ject, we refer for further details to the historical part 01 000 Eutyclopoedis of
