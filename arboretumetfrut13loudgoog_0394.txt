Laricio; aad, in the Forest 01 Fontairiehleau, M. de Larmiuat has grafted
10,000 Scotch pines with scions 01 this raluable tree; an example well
worthy 01 imitation by the pro rietors 01 newly lanted pine woods in Britain.

Iu the different botanic gardens iu France, tliere are arboretums more or
less extensive: the most complete is that 01 the Paris gardan ς but those 01
Meta, strasburg, Montpelier, and Tonlon are also good. 10 the latter there
is a deciduous cypress which, in 35 years, has attained the height 01 soh,
with a trunk 9st. iu circumfereuce close to the ground. From all these gar·
deus, and several others, we have had lists and dimensione 01 the trees, which
will be found under the different genera.

Some 01 the uurseries hare extensive collectione: judging from their sale
catalogues, those 01 Cels, Noisette, and Godesroy appear to be the best in
Paris, or its neighbourhood, and those 01 Audibert 0 Tarascon, 01 the Bau-

manns at Bolwyller, aud 01 Jscquemet-Bonnetord at Ammonoy, seem to be
the most extensive iu the provinces. The Bolwyller Nursery‚ situste near
Mulhausen, in Alsace, was established by M. Josepb Baumann (who was

'l'he iildiriduals who have exercised most iuflneuce on the introduction of
foreign trees aud shrubs into F rauce appear to have been Du Hamel, Andre
Miehaux, and Du Mont de Courset.

Mauri-honis Du Hanrel du Monceau was born at Paris in 1700, and died

he takes his designation. He was appointed inspector 01 the French navy,

Andre Michaux was born 10 the Psrls 01 Versailles, in 1716, aud soon
