returned ιο France with agreat number of trees, which were lanted in the
gardens of Μ. Lamounier, and of the Mareshal de Noailles‚ 011010 they suc-
ceeded perfectly. He 01100 used to take from these gardens apacket of graias,
and, going throuoh the woods 01 Versaillea, he would graii them on the trees
already there. 10 1780, 110 went to botaniseou 1110 mountains 01 Auvergne
with several botanists‚ among whom were Lamarch and Thouin. Michanx
was the most active 01 all of them; besides his musket, haversack, portfolio,
and several specimen bores, he carried in his pocket seeds 01 the cedar oi
Lebanon, which he sowed 10 1010010010 situations. Soon afterwards he went
10 1110 Pyrenees and travelled in Spain; and, in a short time, accompanied the

Thouin, Malesherhes, and others. Parsia at that time was a prey to civil wara,
and Michaux, plundered 01 every 11110 by the Arabs, was supplied with the

Touche, hia biographer observes, thinking that a naturalist, who travelled for
the good 01 humanrty, ought to he protected by every nation. In this [101101
1110 world Michaux remaiued two years, traversing 0100010100 and deserta from
the lodian to the Cas ian Sea, and proving that the provinces situated between
35ο aud 450 of 101110110 10 the East have supplied most 01 our trees, exclusive
ol' those which belong to America. He here verihed the fact first noticed by

home twelve boxes of seeds, aad 5000 young trees, ιο 011101 with some Cana·

are extremely interesting. Wheuever he discovered a new lant, rt inspired
him with such enthusiasm, that he no longer felt fatigue. The discovery 0111
new Pavo, and ol‘ the Pinckndyo pitheus, gave him great pleasure. He arrived at
New Providence in February, 1799, and returned to Charleston in May 01 the
same year. He afterwards visited the highest mountains 01 00101100. The
danvem he experienced there convinced him 01 1110 necessity 01 having two
guides, because one might perish by the road by a thousand accidente, and it
would be impossible for a European 10 11011 his way alone through the
country. 110 found in these 1000010100 vast tracta covered with rhododen-
drons, kalmias, and aaaleas, and with foresta 01 trees altogether impenetrahle.
War, at this time, was declared between Franco andEngland; and Michaux
was afraid 01 being forced 10 leave America. He had been for 0 long 111110
occupied with the idea 01 determining the nativa place 01 011 the American
trees3 and also at what latitudo they begin to grow rare, and where they dis·
appear entirely: in short, he wished to ascertaiu up to what heioht they
