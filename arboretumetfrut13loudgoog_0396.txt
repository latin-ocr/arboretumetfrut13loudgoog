ln higher or lower ground, or in a different soil, these trees become smaller
and more rare. lt was with a view to trace in thia manner the botanical
topograpby of North Americn, that Michaux visited tbe Floridas, and want
as far as Hndson’s Bay. lle left Charleston in April, 1792; arrived at
Quebec inJune of thesame year; and reached Tadoussac, lat. 52⁰, in October,
160 leugues from any human habitation. He afterwards planned a journey to
Mexico, for the benerit of the United States; bnt, aller rery many journeys, he
returned to Paris by Amsterdam, where he arrived on the ad 01 December
1796, after ten years' absence. He found his friends well, bnt was grieved be·
ond measure to learn that the beautiful plantatione of Rambouillet, 10 which
be had sent 60,000 youn trees, had been destroyed during the revolution,
aad that but every small number of the trees was remaining. Seeing that
tranquillitp was restored, he instantly thought of repairing the loss. Alter

F. A. Michaux‚ the author 01 Histoire der Arbrer detritasque, alter his
father’s death, was sent to Charleston, by the French gnvernmcnt, to bring
over the trees collected in bis father’s nurseries, aud supplies of seeds. During
bis stay in Amerina, M. Vilmorin informs us that he sent to the [111000100-
tion Forertidrc larger quantities 01 acorna and otberseeds 01 foreign trees, than
had ever before been sent over from that country. He took that opportunity
of visiting Kentucky, the Tenessee, and of penetrating nearly 0 thousand miles
beyond the All bany Mountalns. On hia return to Europe, he publishcd his

to be as enthusiastically devoted to the study of trees and shruba as his late
father. We are much indebted 10 him for various useful communicatione
having reference to the Arboretum Britannicam. Ι
