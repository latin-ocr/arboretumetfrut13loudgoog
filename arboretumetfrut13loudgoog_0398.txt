correspondent has sent us the following remarks on the subject of the Dutch
1Ι eousflora. “ Many oeuses combine to operate unfavourably 00 the growth

trees and shrubs in Holland ; the numerous heavy vviuds in the ne' bour·
hood of the sea, and more particularly the north-west wind, destroy t e tops
of the high-growing trees, break their branches, and, by shaking their trunlrs,
loosen the roots m the soil, or blow the trees down. This is chiefly occa-
sioned hy the little depth to which the roots can penenate into the ground;
for, as soon as they resch the water, they are compelled to take a lateral
direction, in conse uence 01 which the trees soon become sicltl , 01 are

101 supplying turf or pest, is unfavourable to the growth 01 timber. Shnuld
much rain and stron winds occur, the trees on this soil cannot exist long
enough 10 become ol ,nor even to have good trunlrs. ln order, therefore, 10
prevent their being blown down, they must, from timeto time, be tied or
propped up: but the trouble and expense of this operation cause it to be

renders them more sickly. The tru 01 this fact may be perceived iu the
trees in and about most of the Dutch cities.

‘⁸ Most 01 the country scats in Holland were formerly 0001110110111010, along
the Graveuwej, for example ; and at Amsterdam, in the neighbourhood of the
Diernermeer: hut, as all these scats have been demolished, and new ones
formed 10 the hi h saud grounds 01 the provinces 01 Gueldcrlandand Utrecht,
not man remarlrable old trees remain in the former district. Those which
time mi t have spared have been cut down in consequence 01 the removal
of the country scats. The Populus cenedensis [1 monilifera] appears every
where here in an excellent condition, and grows in plsces where no other tree
will thn've, On the sites 01 some of the old country scats, especially where
the ground is clevated, old tulip trees and cetalpes are found, both of which
bloom freely. The new country scats are laid out with much taste, in arlrs
on a large scale, and on high grounds, in the provinces 01 Utrecht and 11001-
derland; and they ure planted with exotic trees and shrnbs, which affort very
favourable ex 1011000 101 the future. - W.”

they are by no means so in collectione 01 10010 from other countries. This
is ascertained from the early catalogues of the different botanic gardens, and
from the magnificent publicatione on botany and gardening which issued from
the prees 01 Le den, Amstcrdam, and other Dutch or Flemish cities, in the
