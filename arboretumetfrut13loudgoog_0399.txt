'ans at hachen, in the Duc d'Aremberg's seat at Enghien, and that of
' Henry Τ. Oakes near Toumay. The nurseries of Holland are celebrated
for their iniit trees, and those oi the Netherlanda for their magnolias ancl
maleas, and other pent-earth trees and ahrubs. That of M. Parmentier at
Enghien has long been remarkable for containing a great nrany species in a
very limited space; and that of M. lc Candele at llumbeque, near Brussels,
contains the best collection of the genus Oratae⁸gus in the Low Countries.
Some account of this nursery‚ with notices of its more remarkable trees, will·
be found in the Gardener‘s Mogozine, vol. xi. p. 537.

1ιιι consequence of the resent unfriendly feeling between Holland and Bel·
gium, we have been unabie to procure notices of the trees and shrubs of thc
more remarkable places of either country. We know, however, that there are

many fine specimens, and that though the wintere are colder than those of

Eng and, yet that the summere are warmer, and that thc greater part of the
deciduous American trees and shrubs thrive there as well os in England.
Many of the lineet azaleas in our nurseries, and some varieties of magnalia aad
rhododendron, have been raised from seed in the neighbourhood of Ghent.
The wintere, however, are unfavourable for evetgreens, and but few of these
ure to be found in any part of the country. In Smith’s Tour on tle Continent,
Neill's Hortierdtnral Τοιιν, and in various articles in the Gardencr'a ulfagazine,
will be found descriptiva sketches of many of the small gardens of Holland
and the Nethcclands, all more or less remarkable for their Anrerioan trees and
shrubs. Of large places which may be compared with the country seats of
Englaad, and which might be supposed to afford many examples of fine old
trees, there are comparatively few, as has been already observed above bya
correspondent, a native of the country.

'l'nouan this ortion of Europe is of great extent, yet its ligneous liora is
much less varied and numerous than that of France. The reasons ace, that
it extends in longitude more than in latitude3 that it contains few very loll
