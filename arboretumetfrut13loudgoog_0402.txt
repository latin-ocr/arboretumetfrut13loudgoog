By looking into the various¹ catalognes of the German botanic gmdeas, and
particularly into those of Giessen, founded in 1605, and of Altorf, Narem-

erg, Rientel, and upwards of twenty others, founded between tlie commence-
ment of the itth century snd the middle of the iath century, the dates of
the introductioa into Germany of a number of trees and shurbs may be found
by the curione. It will be sufficient for the purpose of this work, if we coin-
· menae with the introduction of American trees and shrubs into Germaiiy,
which took lace shortly aller their introduction on a large scale into France;
the Argytl ol Germany being Prince Lichteosteinof Eisgrub3 and the DuHsniel ⁶
of that count being Baron Otto von Miinchansen of Schwb'bbache, near
¹ Pyrmont, iii estphalia, now united to the kingdom of Hanover. This
ntleman was the authores a work which obtained reat celebrity in German
inhia tinia, entitledDerHanevaierphertherofa ainily). This book, whi
was printed iii 1765, may be compared to the British encylopiedias of
domestic economy, except that in it agriculture, gardening, and rural affairs
bear a more conspicuous part than housewifery and cookery ς it contains a
descriptiva list of new and desirable trees and shriibs, with directions for
their culture, and for their disposition in lines ; argying against clipping thern
into geometrical figures,as was then the mode. eareassured see Gard.
Mag, vol. ii. p. 386.) that it was the reading of this work, and especially the
arguments which it contained in favour of a more natural mode of dis sing
aad managing trees and shrubs in gardens, that gave the Empress Cat arina
a taste for English gardening; and that it was thus the means of introducing
that teste into nussia. As Hanover was at this time closely connected with
England, by being under the governinent of the sanie monarch, there ean be
little doubt that the trees planted at Schwt'ibbache would be procured froin
the aurseries of this country, Conteinporary planters were, iii the Hario-
verian domininus, Count Valtheiin of Harbclie, and Hinnber of Marienwerder
near Hanover: also the ane of Dessau, at Wdrlitz, near Bessan, iii Anhalt ς
the Elector of Hesse, at Wilhelmshb'e, near Cassel ς Prince Lichtenstein, on
his various estates in the Austrian dominions; and the Emperor of Austris,
at Schb'nbrunn, naar Vienna. Besides these princes, and illargraves of Badeo,
already mentioned, the following princes of Gerinany have distinguished them·
salves by planting foreign trees: Frederick the Great, and the present King of
Prassia,Frederick William IV.; the late King of Sason ‚ Frederick hii-
stus IV.; the late King of Wmtembcrg, Fiedericli ll'illiam3 the late
rand-Duke of Weiinar3 the late Duke Ernest of Sars-Coburg-(iotha3 Prisce
Prinus‘of Dahlberg; the Grand-Duke of Frankfort; and the late Duchess of
Courland, at Loebichan in Saxony. We have received Beturri Papersfiom all
these placas, from which we find that soine of the foreign trees first planted iu
them still exist. Schwdbbache is in tlie possession of the grandson of the
author of Der Hausoater, and contains a number ol very interesting trees.
Among these are, a tulip tree, near a pond, 120 years planted, which is 80 fl.
high3 N yssa tqiiduca, 00 years lanted, which forms a magnificent tree 40 a
high, with auwidespreading head and branches drooping to the round: it is
iii a low moist situation, and its route, which extend to a great distance, send
up innumerable snckers3 in tlie autumn the leaves, before dropping off,bs·
coine as red as blood. The lineat tree of tliis kind in England is on the
ane of Wellington’s grounds at Strathfieldsaye; it is 30st. high, and, being
rather iu a moist situation, will probably one day rival the tree at Schwb'b-
bache, which, in all probability, is the linest specimen of Nyssa in Europe.
Cotylae arborescens (1 C. Callima), at Schwb'bbaclie, 100 years planted,
forms a r lar-headed tree, with a straight clean trunk 2ft. in diameter.
Alcer erio ipram, sacchaii'num, and O'palus, have been 00 years planted, and
are noble trees; AE‘sculns Paria and flbva are stately trees, and flower freeiy3
Robinia Pseud-Aciris, 120 years planted, is a lare and most picturasque
tree; Ulmus americiina,12tl years planted, and Juglans cinerea aad nigra,
00 years planted, are noble trees. 'l'here are specimens of Castanea vesca,
