The modern collections of trees in Germany are too numerous to be men-
tioned in this work, and we can only, therefore, give the names of those which
we have been informed arethe most complete.

In Austris there is an excellent collection in the University Botanic Garden
of Vienna, under the care of Baron Jacquin, chiefly planted within the last
twenty years, but 1 part much older. Here the macluras, male and female,
stand in the open air, but require protection during winter. The salisburia
here, and those in several other places near Vienna, flower annually; but they
are all male plante. On that in the Botanic Garden, Baton Jacquin has had
the female grafted with scions from Genava, but they have not yet flowered.
Laxenburg is more remarkable for native trees than forforeignones; but there
are some very large tulip trees, which ripen their seeds every year, and some
{tbl‘ssttttllttlt 1111111111111111111
heightaop 30 ft. in six orgseven yeirs. Baton Jacquin assures us that this is
one of the finest and most picturasque specimens of this tree that can be
imagined. ln the parlr there are many fine oaks of the growth of several
cent'urics; arrd a very comprehensive general collection of trees and shrubs,
of from ten to forty years’ growth. All these have been planted by, and are
now under the care of, Μ. Stephen Rauch, through the exertions of whose
son, M. Charles Rauch, now head gardener at Rennweg, we have received
much of tlre information contained in this section3 while another son, M.
Francis Rauch, now (1835) 11 London, has drawn from nature the greater

of tlre botanical specimens by which this work is illustrated. ln Austris
ι roper there are collectione at Bruck on the Leytha‚ on the borders of Hun-

Vienna. (anopenzel Berg, a hill in the neighbourhood os Vienna, from
which there is one of the hnest views in Europe, there is a tulig tree
60 ears planted, which has an immense globular epreading head, thoug only
451. high. At Bruch,the trees have been chiefly planted within the last eight
or ten years3 but there are some older specimens well (lescrving notice; such
as moer striatum, 1811. high in 20 years; Palidrus australis, 1811. high in
30 years; and Fraxinus arrovirens, left. high in 20 years. At Dornbach
there is a good collection; but very few trees that haye been above 40 years
planted. At Hedersdorf we observed, in 1811, some fine cypress trees
glanted round the tomb of the great Marshal Loudon, but in the Return
aper received they are not mentioned; there is, however, a good collection,
the most rapidly growing tree of which ap ears to be that beautiful species of
elrn, U'lmus ellhsa, whrch, in 20 years, lias attained the height of sesain
poor sandy soil. The Vienna nurscries, especially that of Rosenthal, contaiu
good collections planted within the last 20 years.

There are collections at Eisenstadt, and other residences, in Hungary, and
in the botanic garden at Pesth. ln Bohemia there are collections at Toeplita,
Schiinhoff, and other places.
