The introduction olffireign trees aud shrubs into Russia may dete 11οιιι the
commencemcut ol the re' of catharine, or about the ear 176& when, hom
reading Der Hausvater, ffig ern resa determined on having the gardens at
Tcarsco Celo laid out iu the English manner. From the severity of the
climate, not many foreign species can endure the wintere, either there or any
where else, in the neighbourhood of Petersburg; nerertheless, with laudable
ambition, man species have been tried at all the imperial residences. The
tfrples and shruhs generally used for planting thc Petersburg gardens are of the

The Pinus s bestris and the scies excelse attain a considerable siae in
the elevated light soil at a few milcs’ distance from St. Petersbur ς tho h
in thebo by which that city is surrounded their siae is but smaT. Inte
Taurida Talace gardens, in the city, the U‘lmus campestris has attained the
h ht of 49 fc; the Cerasus Padus, and the Sdrbus aucuparis, of 21 a.; the

uinus excelsior, os 3511.; the strix fragilis, 49 st.; the A'luus glutindsa,
56 st.; the Betula alba, 68 st.; the Larix europala, 6³ ft.; and, what pears
to us remarkable, the Quercus rrlbra, also 63 st. In the summer gar ens of
St. Petersburg, planted during the r ' of Peter the Great, there is a limr.
tree 7911. high; and a common clm affin orway maple, each 7011. h· h.

On the shore ol the Gulf of Finland, opposite the village of strsslna, the
small island of Sosuovy Rosha is entirely occupied with tall Scotch pines,
immenasas art; among which, one bas attained the height ο1 list,
and another ol 6511. ln the imperial den at Strelna ia a common Eng-
lish clm, 0011. high, the branches ο which cover a space of 50 st. The
measurements osa number of trees, grown on the estate ol Madame Con-
stantinoff, at Rudets, near St. Petersburg, have been sentus byoue of
¹the imperial gardeners, with the following introductory remarkst-“ Tha
woods consist princi ally ο1 pines and firs ; the sursace os the ground is covered
¹with long moss (Hffpnumk the sutfece stratum is blsclr earth, bin. deept
below this a stratum, lin. deep, os saud mixed with carth; and under t is
is clay. The greater number ο1 the trees consists of Pinus sylvestris, Abies
'excelsa and Betula. The pines grow with clean straight stema, of from
50st. to 7011. high, to where the branches commence, which extend from
1111. to 2011. more, making the whole height of the tree nearly 10011η Νο
care is taken of the woods; the young trees spring from aelf-sown seed3 and
the strong planta arc suffered to avershadow and destroy the weals ones, till
the former at last become large treas. Where the Pinus sylvestris grows
singly, and has lenty ο1 space to spread its branches, the lower arms are not
rubbed off or 'led when young,as they are where the tree rowsiuathick
wood, but they form immense limbs; the consequence is, that the trunk ο1
the trce becomes full of large lanta, and, though it is more in diameter,
it is less iu height3 the timber, of course, being of little use but as suel.”
