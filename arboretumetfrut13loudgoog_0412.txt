Deleuse mentions Dimidow as having the richest botanic den in Russia,
and as having sent to the Paris gardan many fine trees and s ruhs, nativas of
Siberis. Among these were, Coragrlna Altngdmn C. py meh, and Halime-
dendron argenteum. The catalogue oi Dimidow’a colieetion was published
in 1786, soon aller which the proprietor died, and the collection was dis-
persed. The richest collection in 1814 was that at Gorinlri‚ which suffered

eatly when the French were in possession os that part of the country, and
iis since been destroyed or neglected. 'l'he gardens in the neighbourhood ol*
Messon, though they do not contain 8 great number os li eous species, are
not without some of very considerable size; more especia ly the common or
Scotch pine, tha birch, the white poplar, the aab, the common elrn, and the
white wrllow. This last trec, in t e south of Russia, is planted in smaight
lines 81 apparently interminable lengths, to indicate the road across those
immense ste pes, over which a trave ler may proceed a whole day without
seing any 8 er traca of civilisation than these trees and the post stations.
At least we found this to he the case in 1814. M. Fintelman, one of the
imperial gardeuers at 11188888, visited Britain during the summer ol 1835,
witha view to add to the collection under his oare; and he informed us
that the proprietors ofgardens in his neighbourhood are most assiduous in
the improvement ol their grounds and are most anxious to plant in them
ever tree and shrub that they think at all lilrely to endure the climate.

arsaw, being three degrees further south than Moscnw, enjoys a climate
better adapted l'or the introduction of foreign trees and shrubs; and 8 con-
siderable collection was introduced into thebotaaic gardan there soon alter the
neral peace. On looking over the catalogue ol this garden, published by
id. Schubert in 1824, we find that the eater number ol trees and shrubs
which stand the open air in Berlin also 8 so at Warsaw; but that the Por-
tugal laurel, the common laurel, the laurustinus, the rhododendron, the tree
box, the surae, and the broom‚are not hardy ; and thattheivyand thecomrnon
holl require protection during severe winters. Magndlr'a tripetala and acu·
mindta stand ‘nst 8 wall, with protection‚ as does also the tulip tree.
