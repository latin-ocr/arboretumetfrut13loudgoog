An extremely interesting account of the indigenous and exotic trees of
Switzerland‚ kindly prepared for us by M. Alphonse De Candolle, will be
found in the twelsth volume of the Gardrncr's Mogaar'ne ; and to that we must
refer for the geographical distribution of the indigenous §species conlining
bere ourselves to an extract from it respecting the more remarkable native
trees, and those which are exotic.

The exotic trees cultivated in Switzerland have been introduced by degrees

as ornamental plants3 those now most common are, the horsechestnut, the
catalpa, the tulip trce, several kinds of limes and maples, and the cedar of
Lebanon. Till the beginning of the present century these trees were planted
only by proprietors who had some connexions or commercial dealings with
other countries, particularly with England. There were scarcely any nursery-
meu or botanic gardent at Zurich, Basle, Genera, or Berne, but what were
reduced to confincds ots in the interior of the fortified towns, and which,
consequently, could have little influence on the culture os trees in the
countr.
, Thisystcte of things has changed greatly within the last twenty years. The
new botanic gardan of Genera, planted nr lala, in a less confined situation
than the old one, and conlided to the care of M. De (landollc, has resented
to the public a numerous collection of trees and shmbs, especially of duit trees,
chiefly from the nursery of the Messrs. Baumann at Bollwyller. The sight of
this gardan, which is constantly open to the public, excited the zeal of ro-
prietors, and soon made them anxious to foruf plantations of various kinds of
trees. This gave encouragement to the nurserymen, and their establishrnents
became, in consequence, greatl estended, and their number increased. The
reason of peace and security which has followed a long period of war, has pro-
duced nearly the sanie result throughout all Switzerland. The number of
country scats has greatly increased, particularly near the towns, and, more
especially, in the cantons of Genera, Vaud, Bbsle, and Bernc; and a number
of parks and groves have been planted, which now ornament the country. In
the environs of Genava, for example, the sale of trees and shrubs is four or live
times aa great now, as it was about twenty years ago.

The largest nursery in Switzerland at present is supposed to be that of Messrs.
Duilledouze, at Sacconex, near Genava, which may be fairly estimated now to
coutain nearly 1000 ligneous species, in the botanic sense of the word speciem
and above 2000 species and varieties, if we count among the number the rin-
cipal modifications of fruit trees, roses, and maleas. The other public anclpri-
vate gardens of Switzerland contain few varieties, especially of the hardy kinds,
which arc not in the nursery of Messrs. Dailledouze. In adding, then, about
200 species to those which are to be found in this nursery, and counting
about eighty indiggnous ligncous planta, which have not been taken into cul-
tivation, we shall find that the whole ligncous flora of Switzerland amounts to
about 1300 species. The result of this approximated calculation shows that,
from foreign commerce and improved cultivation, five or six times as many
species pf trees and shrubs arc now grown in Switzcrland, as existed there
originaly.
