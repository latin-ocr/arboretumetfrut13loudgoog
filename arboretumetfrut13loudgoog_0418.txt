Μ. Dunant possesses, on his grounds at Secheron, a Qtrr'rrcus I lex, which is
very fine for the country. ·

At the entrance of the botuuic gardan there is au old Aildntur glandulosa,
much older than the garden. lt measured, iu June, 1833, at the level of the
soil, tlt. 3in. in circumference, arrd was between ‘lo ft. and 5011 high. The
unpleasant smell of its llowers is erceived at half a furlong'a distance, and
its numerous and troublesomes ers rise all round, as far aa 40 a. or sot.
from the tree.

The trees contained in the botanic gardan itsclf are not old, as the rden
has not been established more than 17 years. Among the careat an best·
grown trees which have been planted from 15 to 17 years, we may mention
the following 1- Α Photlnia serrulata, spreading into branches from its base,
and about 121181ιί811 a lllagndlia acuminata, about the same height, with a

the base of the trunk. All these measurements were taken at such ah ' ht
from the ground as seemed most likely to ive the true dimensione oft e
trunk, and to avoid the thickness often roduced by the graii, orat the base,
and these measures were all taken hy . Alphonse De Candolle, in October,
1835. Itis to be wished that a register ol similar measurements were opened
in every botanic garden, in order to verify the date of the introduction, and
the rate of growth, of everys ecies, according to the diverse physicsl cir-
cumstances of each locality. ld· De C. Nou, 1835.)

11181, having been, during the Roman empire and the dark ages, the
centre of civilisation in Europe, would, doubtless, draw from 811 other coun-
tries whatever of their productione was suitable to its climate. Hence the
ligneous flora of Italy includes almost all the trees and shrubs indigenoua
to Greece, Spain, and the Mediterranean islanda, which are in any way remark-
able for their use or beauty. In the following enumeration, taken from
Tenore's Flora Neapolitana, Bertoloni’s Flora Italica, Savi's Bolanicoa Etma-
