and England with North America in the commencement 01 the seventeenth
century; from the settlemeut at the Cape 01 Good Hope by tire Dutch in
16503 and, lastiy, from the discovery of Australis. From all these construes,
but chiefly from the last, a number of trees and shrubs have been brought to
Europe; which, though they require the protection ofa green-housein Engiand,
thrive in the open air in the neighbourhood 01 Naples, in Sicily, and in warin
situations about Genoa Among lndian plants may be mentioned, as growing
frecly in theopen air in 1111101111011111111101111111111110111111111111111-

small 111111 from Syria,'the Acitcia Juutrtss'n, or silk trce. Among those from
North America are, the magnolias, and various shrubs from the southern states,
theagave from Mcxico, and the paimetto from Louisiana. Amon thosefrom
the Cape of Good Hope, are ali the'iigneous Geraniriceae, man 011111 heaths,
the diosmas, the proteas, the meialeucas, and similar species. ibon Australis·
there ere many trees in Italy, which have already attarned a large size ; and
there is scarcely a doubt but that nearly 111 the igneous 110110 that part of
1111 world might be transplanted to ltaly, includin Sicily, with the most
perfect success. As h proof 01 this, we may refer to tlte dimensione of certain
Austraiian trees planted at caserta, in the neighbourhood of Naples, as giren
in the Gurdener'a Megarice, voixi. p. 150.andp.481. It appears that
Eucalyptus roblrsta attarns at Caserta, in a very few years, the height of 100 tt.;

Callistemon lo hhnthus, and Aeaeis heterophyila, upwards of 5011. The
Magnolio grandlfldra has attained the height of nearly 6011.; the camellis
25 ft.; and the melaieuca from 25 11. to 30 st. In t'zrilp, we are informed

by Woods, Hogg, ami other traveliers, the palm and t 1101111 Sycdmorus
grow as freely as in Egypt, the sugar cane and the hamboo nearly as weil
as in the East or West indies, and the papyrus and the nelurnbium suc-
ceed in the waters. As the warmest parts ol Sicily, therefore, admit of
1111111111111111111111111111111111131111111111
southern extremities, the ligneous flora 01 the whole world might, with a very
little assistance from art, be included.

The first introduction 01 foreign trees and shrubs into Lombardy, we are
infouned b Signor Manctti, the director and controller of the viceregal
gardens at ilonea, 10011 place about the year 177ος they were planted by
