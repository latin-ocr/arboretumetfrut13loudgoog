Tun introduction of woody plants from North Amerina into Britain may
be said to hove commenced with the missionaries seut out by compton, Bishop
oi London, oborn the end of the serenteenth century, ond to hore continued
without interro tion ever since. Some species were, douhtlees, introduced
by Sir Walter eigh end others, but the practice oi sending out collectore
to send home objecto ol' notursl history undoubtedly began about the period
we hove mentioned. We hove soen, in eredingffif this history, thet
Banniater, Cetesby, (iarden, John and illiam ,Andre Michnux,
Frsser, L on, and Dou las are the nomes of the collectore to whom we ste
chieflyin hted: und at Co ton, the Dulce ol Ar ll, Lord Petre, the
Dulce of Richmond, Ellis, Dr. vedsle, Dr. Fothergi and, above cll, thot
most excellent man Peter Collinson, oqoaker and linendrapcr, were the prin-
cipsl amsteurs. These gentlcmen, and Gray, Gordon, end other nursuymen,
in Britain, ond Du tiamsi, Lemonnier, and Msrechal de Nosne, in France,
were the principsl percus who enco thecollectors. Much,slso,isdue
to those American und Europeon eu ors who have ex lored the interior
os the civilised portion of Amorion, und ublished the result of their lshours.
