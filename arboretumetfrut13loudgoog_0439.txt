Tus trees and shmhs furnished by South America to the British flora are
only 22: nor can it be supposed that that number will he materislly increased,
the botany of the country havin been very generally explored hy different
botanists. 0ur hopes are chiefy from the 'temperate zones of the loftier
rnoturtains, and from the shores of the sea and the larger rivers. ΜΓ. Mathews,
who has been several years in Soath America as s natural histor collector,
speaks 'of losty mountain ranges covered with foreste, which have never
et been penetrated by civilised nran. (See Gard. Mag, vol. xi. p. 6³6.) The
kenenus vegetation, however, of South Amerlcs appears to be much less varied
than that of North America, and to consist chiefly, in the warmer parts of the
country, of palms, and in the more temperate regions, of pines, firs, aad other

colnfiflifflihspect to the introduction into South Americs of trees and shrabs

which are foreign to it, we find that the same tendeucy to equalisstion of pro-
ducts has taken lace here, ns hasbeen the case everywhere else where civilised
man has established himself. Euro ean and North American trees and shrnbs
are to he found more .or less in the governmcnt gardana of Rio de laneis-o,
Buenos Ayres, the Caraccas, and other places, and in. the gsrdena of old
established European merchants and government officere. The tea shrubs of
Chius, the mulberry·, the mango of india, the peach of Persia, the pino-epple
of Africa, roperly ali ons. lant, aad the epple of Europe, are all to he
