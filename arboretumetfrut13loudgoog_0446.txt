at Cbarlestown; or if the whole could be assembled in one grand parlr aad
yrleasureground at Washington. We do not, however, expect tlua ιο he
done; for, in the progress of civilisation and refiuemant iu every country,
there are many much more important points to be attended to thau the cul-
ture of trees and ahrubs.

With a view both ιο introduction into any parricidas country, and equalis-
ation in all similar countries‚ the first thing at ought to he done, after the
indigenous planta of the country are clearly determined,ia to assemhle, in
one gardan in the given country, all those of all other similar aeunnies, “
with a view ιο detmmining what they are. Thus,in the case of mear and
shrabs, all those mentioned in the preceding lists as being foreign, with refer-
ence to the trees and shrubs of Britain, ought to be assembled arrd proved in

hut it is hard to say what will not be done by uatrhns, when they come td
cultivate with ardour the arta of peace and of refinement. The cooperation
of individuale attached to thesaure pursuit may, in the mean time, contribute
nrucb to the advancernent of that pursuit; and hence, though in the ne'gb-
bourhood ol' London it might be difficult, or inipossible, ιο induce the metro-
polis or the government to form au arboretum of 150 acres in extent, so as
ιο exhibit in rt all the species of trees and shrubs of temperate elimatos, that
will gvow with ns in the open air ς yet, if the proprietors of a certain number
of estates within tan miles of London were to agree each ιο form a collec-
tion of the species or varietiea of a particular us, and to allow these to be
examiued by botanista, the same result would obtained, at least aa to sc-
curacy of nomenclature,asiftl1e whole of the genera and species were .-
resembled in one uatioual gardeu. We bave explained thie cooperative ays-
tem, at length, in the Gnrdener’r Magoar'ne, vol. xi. p. 6⁰0.,'and rt is ueadless
to say that it ia ns applicable ιο every other country aa to Englaud, and ιο
every other large town as to London. The practice might, therefore, be
adopted in the neighbourhood of Edinb and Dubliu; and in that of
Eaeter, for the south of En laud; Bristo and Live l, for the west;
York, for a central situation ς orwich, Lincoln, and H ,for the eaat; and
Newcastle and Garlisle, for the north.

The number of works which have been written, exclusively devoted to the
description and uses of trees aud shrubs, shows, in a geumal point ol view,
the mtimated importante of tbe subject by authors3 and, when we consider
thera idity of the successies of these worhs within a comparativel limited
period: it shows the accumulation of knowledge which is contin ly being

ties, as, in the nge in which these books were produced, excited most atten-
tion; while tbe last are scientifio descriptione, with the geography, history,
and uses in civilised society, of all the species and varieties enumerated..

The conclusion which we draw pith reference to the literature of trees
and sbrubs is, that, though there are a great man excellent worlrs ou the
subject already before the public in the En lish, drencb, and German lau-

uages, yet none of these works embrace e whole subject, and bring it
down to the present timer and that, consequently, we are justified in our

endeavour to com rise every thing which it rs desirable to lmow, respectiug
