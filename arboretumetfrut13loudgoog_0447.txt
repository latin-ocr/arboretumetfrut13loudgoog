CHAP. Ι.

OF 'riis STUDY 01? TREES ricbertum, OB As COMPONENT PARTS 01¹
GENERAL SCENERY.

Tira study of trees, as component parts of landscape, may becarried on with
very little knowledge of either their natural or their economical history, and,
indeed, with less knowledge of any other objecta or seiences‚ than most studies.
Experieuce proves that a man may excel as a graphio artist with very little
knowledge be ond his srt; but, at tbe same time, it is also found, from expe·
rience, that alh the greatest artists have beem more or less, philosophers; and
hence, though a knowledge of the natural and economieal histor of trees may
not be essential forthe artist who studies them pictorially, it wlf yet be found
to render him material assistance.

The subject of this chapter naturally divides itself into the study of the forms
of trees and shrubs; the study of their character and expression ; and the art
of delineating thern pictorially.

Tne first quality in a tree which will atrike a general observes, coming to
tbe study with only a few notions relative to form, will be itabulk, or the space
that it occu ies in the landscape which meets his eye. This bulk, or mag·
nitude, reserves itself into height and width; and the consideration which
immalhately follows is, the outline that the tree makes against the sky, or
against any other object which appears behind it. 'l'he next points that will
probabl attract notice are, the colour of the tree,'and the degree of brilliancy
of tbe ‘ hts which appear on its messes. subsequently, the attention may be
drawn to the tiunk of the tree: for example, to observe whether it appears to
bs adequate to the support of the head 3 whether the head ap equally
balanced on it5 and whether it stands perpendicularly or Obliquepye'atrp the sur-
