other ramese-hesded trees, the length of naked trunli bears a much less pro·
portion to the head. Shrubs are distinguished from trees, not only pictorially,

ut also botanically, by having no distimt truok, or uaked stem, but, whether
large or small, forming one entire burh.
he trunks of trees may farther be considered with reference ιο the manner
iii which they riae out of the soil, and to the manner in which the head of the
trec is supported by them. Trees which grow iu thick woods, where tho
annual crop'of leaves falls down, and rota into nond, have their trunks

adds moreto the effect ofatree,as a stately and durable object iii alandscape,
than the ap mrancc of its trunli, rising from a secure and widely spreadmg
base ; and is appearance is one which may be imitated by art, both iu drawing
landscapes, and in landscapegardening,and whether the trees to beintroduced
mTkkupigryigudiiiilarity or inclination of the trunks of trees are circumstances
well deservmg the study of the artiat. Wherever trees have grown up for·
tuitously in groups or inesses, the trunks of many of them will be found more
or less inclined to the horizon ς and their heads will often appear ill balanced
when taken singly, though in combinatione such trees make the most varied

heads. Such trees always have iiie ap earance of having bisen planted by art;
while the others seem to¹ convey the ifea of their having been subjected to the
operation of natural causes. Trees of the first kind may be called gardenesquc
trees, aud of the latter, pictoresque trees. Trees which grow out of rocks, or
ou precipices, or on the baiiks of water, almost always have their trunks in-
clined to the horizon3 as trees on level sursaces, other circumstances being
the same, have their truuks at right angles ιο the horizon.

Though shrubs are without trunks, yet the same general remarks will a ply

some shrubs, as in the common laurei, the branches trail on the ground ς in

ahrubs have stems which twinc round, or are otherwise supported by, trees or
other objects; such aa the ivy, the clematis, ὄιος and others riae up, and fall
down, as iu the case of the common bramhle. Some shiubs are, iii their details,
like a collection of miniature trees; as, for example, the butcber’s broom. ln
