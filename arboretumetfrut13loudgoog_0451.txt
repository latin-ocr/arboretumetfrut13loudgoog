a botanical point oi view, the variety which trees and shrubs yresent, with re-

spect to therr hunlrs and branchos, ra almost endless: but we
only to consider them with a view to pictorial effect.

, The mode qs growth ia herr aad rhrwbr varies according to the kinds3 andis
modilled only in a slight degree by situation, soil, aud climate. The main sterns
of almost all trees have a tendency to grow u right; but the branchos roceed
Ιιιοιιι these stcms in different directions in ⁶ ent trees. The growtlis, that
rs, the branchlets aad spray produced by the branches, entend themselves
honzontally in some esses, as ιιι the oah; upwards iu others, as in the beech;
and in some downwards, as in the weeping willow and the weeping birch. ln
some they are rigidly uprigbt and compact, as in the Lombardy poplar; and in
others they are upright and sparse thetis, thin),asin the nocladus. ln

more conspicuous than insucb as are crowded, because the nehus of the tree,
ιιι such situations, is more perfectly developed.

ln shrubs, the mode ofgrowth is osten the principal circumstance by which,
in a pictorial point oi view, they can be characterised ; because they bave not
sufficient m itude to admit of great variety os form, or oi outline: they arc
without trrm s to admit oi variety of attitude; and they are without large
branchos to admit of marked character. Thoanta, therefore, in order to
render them interesting, must have recourse to their mode oi growth‚ and to
their foliage3 and ior these reasons, also, they ought almost always to be
placed in the for und, both of picturas and of garden landscapes.

Themodeof ' ,that is,the mode in which the leaves combine into those
messes which appear on the suriace of the tree, varies with the lrind of tree;
and de ds princi ll on the mode of growth, though, to a certain extent,
it is indridnced by t e lium of the leaves. The general form of tuiis is round·
rab, or ellrptical ; thelon axis of the ellipsis, or of the roundish tigne, being
universally in a horizontad direction. One tust is separated from another by
mtervals oi shade in the body οι the trec, and by the bachground where the
tulis compose the marginal outline. All tufts have their margins more or less
indented, which depende on the forms and clusters ol the leaves.

The kooer estrees arrd rhmbr are almost as various as the species; but, pic-
torially, their forms arc chiefly noticeable only so iar aa they combine roto
massas. A single leaf, in a trec viewed pictorially, is at such a distance from
the eye as seldom to be seen in its entire form ; but something of the general
form of the leaves is recoguisable in the margins oi the tutis of foliage, and
more especially in those w ich are nearest to the eye. The margins of these
tufts may be said to be almost always more or less indentcd or serratedr the
serratures differing in magnitude, in depth, in direction,and in being more or
less blunt at their extremrties.

The »prag ry trees, thetis, the last made shoots on the extremities oi the
brauchlets, rs es various as the species os trees. Ιιι some it is horizontal, as
in the silver fir ς in others it is pendent, as in the larch, the wecping willow,
and in some speeies of birch3 in others it isrigid, as in the gymnocladus;
and iu others croolred,'as in some of the ealrs and thorns; in some it is
thick, and unmarlred by buda, as in the fig and the welnut; in others it is
clothed with leaves throughout the year, as in all the evergreens.
