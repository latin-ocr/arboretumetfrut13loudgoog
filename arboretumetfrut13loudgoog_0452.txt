with light airy ibliage and a wavy stem, will be called grateful ς and so on.

Charccter is some circumstance added to expression, which readers it more
remarkable; and the circumstance which has thie effect will generally be
found ιο be the occidental exaggeration of some quality belo ‘ng to the
natural ex ression ol the object. For exam lc, in the case handsome
regularly cliothed trees, supposing a number oi theru standing together, cha·
racter would be added to one of them by the extraordmary prolo ation and
magnitude of one or more cf ita branches3 orb some of ιιι branc es having
been taken away, so as to expose a portion oi e trunlr conspicuously, while
the remainder continued clothed. Character would also be added to one
nce, amonga number ol the same lrind all previously aliiae, if a portion ol'
this tree were scathed by lightning3 or il‘ some circumstance were ιο οοοιιι’
which threw the trunlr over to one side. ln either ol the latter cases, what
is called character would be conveyed by the object displayin cons icuoosly,
something which did not naturally belong ιο its speciem wb' in eformer
οοοοὲἒιιιιιιιᾶιιοι was giren by the exaggeretion oi some quality which was
natu ιο e cotes.

The expressirin of neca may be said to be ol two kinds: that which pro-
ceeds hom their organic influence on the eye as lonas, without reference
ιο their nature, and altogether spart from moral associations3 and that in
which moral macciations are the principnl cause ci the expression. '

Supposing a person to see atree orahrub for the first time, aad tobe
totally ignorant of ite nature ι be could only loolr upon it in the light oi a
form3 and, in this case, its expression, to him, would depend upon its re·-
semblance to forms which he previously Ιιιιειι, whether geometrica! dputes,
or the figures of other objecta. Thus itis, that the inst edbrt whic the
mind makes to discover beautp¹ in naharai t'orrnr is, to rocognise in them
some of the lomna oi art ;‚and cuce, in the infant state ol' this toste in indi·
viduals, the first trees that would be admired would be those the heads οι
which bore the nearest resenrblance to a globe, a cone, or some readily recog·
nisable figure. The next step would be the recognition of some artificial
figure, in the trees or ehrubs ol more regular outlinee. Το this would suc·
ceed the recognition ol* several ligures contained within one general ligure;
and, lasti , the recognition, arnong these seweral figuras, os regularity in their
arra emeat, or ol symmetry in their disposition3 of variety3 ol intricacy3
and, tly, oi harmony and of character. ln thia way it wrll be seen, that
a tree or a shrub is capable of erciting many ideas of besuty, considered
simply as a sorm, and altogether apert from consideratione of usefirlness, ol*
botanical intereat, or of moral associatione.
