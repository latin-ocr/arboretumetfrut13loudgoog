my, must exhibit the nme number ol tufts of the ηηιηο site, arrd at the
saruc distance from each other, on both eides ol the uunl, or centra lino.
Such a trec, as awhole, we may suppose to be a r lar globular figuret
and itis a· property oi regularity, that one portion o anyfi ure which is

regrdar, being ted from the rest, will still be regrdsr. l the globular
head ol the regu tree, therefore, were cut exectly in two, either vertically
or horizontally, the smaratel portione, would each be regular figures, that ie,
wilri-{lxmam tree, οη the other hand, there may be the greatest irregu-
lanty ιη the form aud number oi tho parts, provided, only, tlrat the same
quantity of these be distributed οη each side of the centrol vertical line, or
munli, of the tree. ln the lower art of the trec, the branchos or tultings may
protrude chiefly on theri ht hnndand bel ; aod,on theu per put nithe
tree, they mayprotrudec 'elly on the leli¹ d‚and be amah or they may
be oi mixed nzes in both places. Now, rt rs the characteristic property ol' a
symmetrioul figure, diat, when it is cut in two, the parts separated, taken
er y, are neither regular nor syrnmetricnlt end, consequently, that they
wil notproduceawhole iu any way, unless the arereumted as they were '
before. By imagining aucha trce as we beve d
portione by a central vertical line, it will reedily occur to the mind, that
neither ol these portione was either regular, or could in any way form a
whole. Whoever wishes to enter on the study ol' the expression os regulerity,
symmetry, intricacy, and harmony, iu detail, may refer to articles on the sub·
jeet in the lirst volume of the Arols'tecturol Megarice.

'l'he lowest degree of organic houm, in a trec, we may suppose to be the
form ol a small-smed tree with alumpish head, like the Pyrus anim consti-
tuting one uniform mass, light οη οηο sideraad shaded on the other. A
higher degree of beauty will be, where the genmol form ol the mass is thet of
acone, or where it isegg-shaped; beccum these forms contain an additional
element of beauty to that constituting a globo, viz. that ol elongation. A
still higber degree of beeuty will be produced, where all the branchee ol the
trec, in the csse either of a globe or cone, ure distinctly marked and larly
placed on each side of the trualt, as in the case ol a fir ς and one still ' hor,
where the branches end tulta proJect irregularly, bnt are still so balanced, οη
each side of the centrata tolorm‚ οη the wholeasymmetrical ligure. Such
aligure, where the tulis are nummons, varim in point oi siae and dispositiom
and, where the symmenyis perfect, will exbibit the greatest orgamc beauty
