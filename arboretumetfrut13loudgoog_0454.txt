200 SClENCE OF THE stunt OF TREES· rant 11.

tree, as it must add greatlyto the eanyrnent derivabis frorn them, ought,
always to form a part of therr mdrvrdual rstory.

One of the most common and generally understood expressions of trees is,
that which is called their picturaque hasty. Much has been written, by
Gilpin, Uvedale Price, and others, in order to detine the meaning of the word

ictures uer and the expression of this beeuty has been divided into two
kinds: at of the beautiful, or smooth pictoresque, suitable for cultivated
ppenggydand also for pointing; and that of the rough picturesque, aniame

and forest scenery, and erninently so for hic representation.
whether by the pencil, or the pelette. Among trees, w ether rn a wild or
cultivated state, sre found both these expressions; and, ss an example of the
first, we may give young specirnens of the willow and the lime, and young
trees generally; and of the second, the oak, the cedar, the thorn, arrd old

which, hom some occidental causehas grown to one side, ma be as ‘c-
turesque as a tree which grem erect, and is comparatively pe ect in a its
parts; provided only that itis not apeculiar tree,such as that shown in
fig. l.p. 195. The only thing which is manual to pictoresque beauty in a
tree, is, that it should be capable of readily grouping with another tree, or
with any building‚ object, or animm, so that the combination may forrn a sa-
tisfactory whole. Itis evident that this remark applies alike to trees of the
rough picturasque, and of the smooth picturesque: since young trees,
which belong to the latter kind of beeuty, will group together, or with other
abjecte, Just as readrly es old trees which belong to the former kind of tlns
ex ressron.

rn therr regilarrty and symmetry. A truly gardenesque tree, when fully
grown has always some of its branches depending on the ground, in order to
mark stasatree of the gardan or larvn3 and not one of the park, where its
lower branches would be separated frorn the ground bythat horizontal line
formed hythe browsing of cattler or one of the forest, where, from being
pressed oph other trees, or, when young, growing up under the shade of an
old tree‚1tsibrm would necessarily belongto some division of the pictoresque,
or be uliar; and peculiarity, m trees, as in other objectare Sir Joshua
Reyno ds has shown, rs deformity rather than beauty.

Arcldtecturol aad coeptumque trees are now no longer in reputet but we
seenoresson whytrees should not be cut into the forms of colonnades,
arcades, triumphal arches, and the figures of men and anirnals, as shrubs are
cut into the form of those green walls which, under the name of hedges, sepa·
rate our fields; and exone planta are dwarfed, bybeinggrown in pots or
boxes ς and fruit trecs flattened by being spread out against walls. We do not
say that &cades of trees, tonsile bowers, and sculptured evergreens, such as
were formerly common in French ens, rank high in the scale of vendant
beauty; we merely essert that t ey are productiva of distinct kinds of

· beauty; and that it is by no means desirable tu be exclusive, and limit our

nodone of what is beauty to that which is highest in the scale, or to those
kinds only that hoppen to be fashionable in our time.
