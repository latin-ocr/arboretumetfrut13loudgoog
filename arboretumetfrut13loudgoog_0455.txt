those which had afforded him food or shelter: in a highly refined state, they
would be those which ufforded him the greatest amount of intellectual en joy-
ment, including their beauty us orgauic forms, their beauty ss constituti ng a
particular species of a class of organised bein ,aud their beauty as giving nse
to pleasing or interesting associatione. Per aps the most interesting associ-
ation connected with trees is that of their being employed iu ship-building3
bacam without ships, mankind must have remained ιιι isolated portione, and
could never have been· highly ciyilised. Itis probable, therefore, that, in
fls'lulllzhllt‘tllfttllircil,llfslzhttslllltlhhlh
consider such trees as the most beautiful. ln Europe and America, the oak

is the tree chiefly used in ship-buil ' ; aud it is, at the same time, unques-
tionably fuller o variety and beduty o organic form, and of colour, and light
and shade, than any other tree of temperate clirnates; the oak, therefore, to

the most refined ο the inhabitants of these countries, may be considered as
the most beautiful of trees.
There are, also, associatione of a local nature connected with various spe·
cies of trees, which, when known, add to the pleasure of the beholder of the
icular species: for example, the antiquity of the celebrated chestnut at
llliiltworth or of that on Mount Etna, or the celebrity of the platanus at
Buyukdere on the banks of the Bosphorus; orof the clm under which the
founder of the state of Penusylvania signed the first treaty with the ludians;
er of the sycamore of Trous, under which the deputies of the Swiss met in
1424, to swear to free themselves from the yoke of their lords3 leuds an interest

but not a botanist, who had never read the history of the cedar, would feel uo
more interest ιιι a young plaut of that spectes, even rf spnugrng from one of
these trees, thau iu a spruce fir. A knowledge of the moral aud historicsl
associations connected with trees adds, generally, to the interest of those
which ars still young. ln general, it is thought that such trees can have but

This opinion cau only have arisen from the general ignorance, and conse-
puentuwant of interest, which prevail respecting· trees as organised beings3

with them. The source of interest ru objecta generally, consists tn their posi·
tive beauty and utilit ι and iu their susceptibility of vmiation,or of changes, in
their expression of this beauty and utility. ‚NOW if we compare young trees
with old ones iu these respecta, we tluuk rt will not be denrcd that young
trees are objects of much greater interest than old ones. In a picturesque
point of view, we allow that the old tree has an advantage ; it has also the
advantage in point of shelter and shade; aud, if it were to be cut down, it
would produce more timber. But will au old tree provea source of as much
interest ιο the possessor of it, by its venatione, iu cons uence of its yearly
increase in site, as ayoung tree, provided that possessor as a historicel and
gardeuing knowledge of trees? We think not ι and we would only ask any
one who is of a different opinion, whether, ir he were to be allowed to heve
only one tree in his garden, he would prefer a tree often ears’ growth, or a
tree that was already full grown? With the latter trec the mind is carried
back to times which, though interesting in some respecta, it is desirable
should never recum with the former, it is carried forward ‚⁸¹⁰¹JB, with all 'the
