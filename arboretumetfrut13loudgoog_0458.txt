gram, aa is done inst· 2. The parallelogram suited for an octavop e
, rs t rn. broad, and 'ly ιιι. long, and the drvrarons area fourth of an inuh .

This parallelogram admits of adrawing of a tree 30 ft. high, with its brauchea ·

extending over aspace retis diameter. These dimensrons may be con·
sidered as the maximnm for trees ten years planted, even under the most
favourable circumstancea3 and therefore this siae of page, aud this scale, are
what we have, adopted for our Arboretum Britanniam. One page being
marked as in fig. 2., all the other pages in the hook, or any number of separate
peges, may be marked in asimilnr manner by pricking through them from the
different divisione of the scale.

For the urpose of drawing full-grown trees within the limita of the same
aized paralielogram, we assume aaa. as themaximum height of the tree,
and le a. as the maximum diameter of the space covered by the branches;
and, for this purpose, the same division of the inch into four parts will
suffice, but with this differente, that each of these arts must now be con·
sidered as Βῆ.. instead as of lft. ’.2. is marked in this manner, in
the iuside of the parallelogram, for ol trees; and it is marked in the
manner before deshnbed, on the outside of the parallelogram, for young trees.
In ¹practice, it is unnecessary to mark the figures, as the draughtsrnan will
eas
90 a in he' ht, aud ta h. in width, tha margin ma be eucroached on, to the
extent of h an inch on each side, and at top and bottom, which will afford
space for a trec 102 ft high, and with a head ont. in diameter.

The draughmman may now be considered as having got his directim aa
far as respecta paparand scale. Having prepared his pages, he will next pro-
cura two blech-lead pencils, one hard, and the other hard and black (tech-
nically a and a a), together with afoot rule and achair. The nextthingto be
done iv, to choose the tree aud the aspect from which it is to he drawn ln
making a choice, the average form, h “ t and character of the species ought
ιο be taken, as far as practicable; an not aspecirnen remarkable either for
its h ' ht, or for its singularity or peculiarity; and the point from which it is
ι ιο Ιιέἔιονιη ought, if possible, to be on the south, south-east, or south-west

sideof it. The ruleis, that the arn ought always to be behind the draughts-
man, and rather to the left than ιο the right of him. All other circumstances
beingthe same, therefore, when a trecis to be drawn in the morning, the
draughtsman ought ιο place himself on the south-east side of it, at mid-day on
the south side, and in the asternoon on the south-west side. The next int
is, the distance from the trae at which the spectator oughtto placa ⁸ . If
he sits, which is, in general, the best mode, though soma artists prefer a atand-

trae once, twice, or thrice hia own height, otherwise the height of his eye
above the lowest branches of the trec might cause the bracchas to conceal
more of thetrunk thau would be desirable. lt may be useful ιο add, that the
principle on which the ᾱίειοηοο is chonen is that of being able to see the tree
as a whole, or aa an andra mass of light and shade easily comprehended hy

chauging the position of the eye. kx rience has shown that the eye cannot

be behind thes tator rather than in front of him, and at his left hand rather
than at his rig t,is, that aportien of the tree may be in l' ht, and another
portion in chade, in order ιο show ita general form and rotunditfflnd that the
portion in shade may always be, for reasons ιο be hereafter given, on the
right hand. In many¹ cases, it may be necessary ιο draw the tree from thc
