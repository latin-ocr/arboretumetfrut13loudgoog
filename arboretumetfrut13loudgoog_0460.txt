The artist having chonen his tree‚aud lixed his chair at the proper distance,
the next step is, to measure or estimate its height. lnthe case of young trees,
this is easily done hya lO-ft. rod, which, added to the height of a man and the
length of his arm stretched above his head, will 've ts .; which will cover
the height of most trees of ten years’ growth. the case of old trees, the
height moy be ascertained by a common quadrant, bys graduated quadrant,
or, which rn ractice, and more especially when trees are crowded together,
will be founpthe best of all modes, by pushing up the side of the trunk a
series of rods connected one with the other by small tiu tubes. This, and
various other modes, will be found described in Gard. Mag.. vol. xi. p. 5484
aud the subject will be again adverted to when treating of useful plantatione,
end felling timber, in Part IV. of this Eucyclopoedia.

The next step isone of sorne importance. The artist should up close
to the tree, examine its leaves, and make slretches of an individue leaf, and
of a cluster of leaves, both to a larger scale than that to which the trec is ιο
be drawn, eud theu to the same scale ιο which the tree is to be drapo.

all the various forms which s tree clothed with its leaves presents ιο nature,

'l'he young artist, however, must uot suppose, from all this, that to repre-
sent a tree it is only necessary ιο know the form of its leaf aud of its touch ς
neither must he suppose that, in makiu out the details of the tufling or
subordinate messes of a tree, he is mer y to repeat leaf aller leaf : on the
contrary, having a knowledge of the forms of the leaves when examined
siugly, and of their clustering as exhibited on the points of the branchos in
the general outline of the tree when examined 's' ly, and also of the tuftirtg‚
or subordinate messes, of the tree when examinlkllsingly, he must copy from
natiue, almost without reference to his knowledge of these details3 lest, instead
of making a picture of the troe as it is iu nature, he should portray only his own
ideas of how a tres ought to be drawn. We repeat, that he cannot too closely
