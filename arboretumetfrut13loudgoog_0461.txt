One og the many difficulties we hare had to contend with, in getting the
drawings and engravings of trees prepared lor this work, is, the tendeney, both
os draughtsmen and engrsvers, to show here and there in their pertraits, and
sometimes, indeed, throughout the whole pertraits, the distinct shepes ol
the individual leaves. This is just aa bad us it would be, in making a drawing
of a house, to give the dishnct shapes of tbe bricks. It is true, that the
surface of a tres is composed of leaves, as a house is composed of bn‘cks;
but our knowledge of these facts is not the result of our looking at the tres
er house at a dmtanee ss a whole, or as u mere mass of light, shada, and
colour, but of knowledge ol another kind, quite otherwise acquired. Now,
is the artist would only bear constantly in mind, that he is not required to
eonvey, in his picture oi the object represented, more knowledge than what a
person who knew nothing of its nature mi ht acquire by looking at it from
adistance, he could not fail to succeed. lire very expression, “Art’' im·
plies that the ordinary manner of conveying ideas is not to be adopted3
and to show that a trec is eomposed ol leaves,or a house built of brieks,
by giving definite figures ol the one or the other, is taking a license which

It may be remarked here, that the touch of young trees is in no case so
powerfirlly marked and characteristic in natureae that of old trees, sor reasons
familiar to every dener, and which it may be well to notice here for the
sake os artists. e have already said that the tauchis formed by the cluster·

course, are long, and terminate in a very lew leaves, plac alternately or
otherwise, round the shoot or axis, and at some distance, often an inc or
more, from each other. Such leaves can never form those striking clusters
which are so conspicuous in most old trees; particularly in the oak, the
starry touch of which, and es cially that of the Quercus pedunculata, which
is very different srorn that oleeuercus sessililldra, is well known te every
artist. The terminating shoots of old trees are generally shoots which grow
only an inch or two, or, perhaps, not so much, every yearr and, conse uently,
according to the manner in which trees grow,whatisonl asin lel in the
young tree ol' ten years’ growth, is, in the spray, or terminalbranches, of the old
tree,aspur of several years’ growth; that rs,itissspur or shootol half sninch
or more in length, protruding from the other shoot, aod terminating in a clus-

speeies, there is a certain distinctiva characteres touch even iu young trees,

and much more so in some species than in others3 ahorsechestnut, for in-

large sine and marked form of its leaves: so have all other trees having large

It may not be irrelevant to observa that there is as great a differente between
the characteres the ramilieation olan old tree aud that of a young one, ss
there is between the character os their touch. There is a certain degree ot'
sameness in the dispositiones the branches oi all young trees, from their
tendeney upwards, and perhaps still more from their being so fully clothed
with leaves. Old trees, on the other hand, have generally a majority of their
branches in horizontal or very oblique directions, and they are never so fully
covered with leaves and spray as is the ease with »young trees. Aa a result ol
what we have stated, the general forms os young trees present a certain degree
oi sarneness; while in old trees ol distinct species there is generally a very
