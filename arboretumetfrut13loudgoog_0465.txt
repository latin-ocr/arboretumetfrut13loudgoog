Tan purpose lor which we prppose to glance at the study ol trees aad

arrangement which we have adopted in placinp them together3 lor distin-
gurshmg between species and veneunt and or the screntrfic descriptione
which we have adopted. lt must he evident to the render, that, before any

usecan bemadeo the histo ofanytree or shrub, means must he devised
