some place, oroi some individual. li we look at the column, in such cata-
logues, which indicates the native country of the species, the difficulty is in·
creased rather than lessened: perhaps a native of the tropica is laced next a
plant srom the frigid zone. In thia, aa in similar cases os co ecting know·
edge‚ the first step is to accumulate facts, and the second is to generaliae on
them. Hitherto it would ap ear, that, as iar as regards species and varicum,
the great object oi botanists has been to increase their number, without much
regard to groupin them accordingtotheirrelationship. ltisnotforus even
to try to remedy t is evil in respect to all the species and varieties of plantas
but we pro se to attempt to do so, in aa far as respecta the hardy trees and
shrubs of ⁹ ritain. We shall notice, in succession, the subjecta ol species,
races,var1etres, and variationsy and we shall then offer someremar on ¹
mules, hybrida, and what are called botanical species.

· Aspecier is defined, by Dr. Lindley, to be “ a union of individuale agree·
rng wtth each other in all essential characters oi vegetation and ructfficaaon a
capable of reproduction by seed, without chauge; breeding irecly together»
and producing perfect saed, from which a fertile progeny can be tested-’³
(lotrad. to Bot, p. 365.) This, we believe, is the general definitior· of a
species by botanista; but it evidently requires some moufioeuom for,1n tha
case of many cultivated annual planta, the variety or rece is reproduced
from seed; and, consequently, is reproduction from seed were considered as
a certain test, red, white, woolly-cared‚ and smooth-chaffed wheat, would
be so many distinct speciest as would the different varieties os cabbeges
turnip, common lupius, dcc. ln lite manner, also, the different varietres of
particular species os cultivated fruit trees, mi ht be deemed speciea; for it is
certain that saedlings from such varieties of duit trees, when no crosa fecun-
dation has been effected, always bear a nearer resemblance to the variety
which produced the seeds, than to any other variety, orto the original spe·
cies. he truth we believe to he, that trees and shrubs are subjected to the

same law, in regard to the reproduction of varieties irorn seed, as annual
plants3 though, from the varietres oi the former seldomer falling under our
observation, and requiringa longer time to corne to maturity, we have not
the same opportunity oi becoming sufficiently impressed with the identides
oi their natures as ιο be able to generalise on them. On examining a num·
ber oi individual trees or shrubs, raised from seed gesy, for exarnple, oalrs

in an osk wood, or hawthorus in a hedge which as not been cut),we
shall not find two individuale exactly alike, either in foliage, in flower, ia
fruitio mode of growth, or even in the earlineas or latenesa ol budding,
flowering, ripening the huit, or dropping the leaves. We have no doubt,
reasoning from the analogy ot* the whest, that, if the acorns or haws of any
marked variety in euch a wood or hedge as that mentioned were sown, and
the planta reared to maturity, they would be found (unless crosa fecundation
had been accidentally or artificiali effected) more lile the parent variety
than any other in the wood or hedge, justas in the caseos sesdlinga from
varieties of wheat, cabbage, or fruit trees.

'l'heae ma be called cultivated vatieno, or, according to De Candolle,
recca,- but ere are others, which we shall call occaecat vardeties that we
are not so certain can be continued by seed. For example, there are wceping
varieties oi certain trees, such as the common aah3 and fastigiate varieties
oi others, such as the Exeter elm, the &magus Oxyacintha stricta, and the
Lombardy poplar (P. fastigidta), which we believe to be only an accidental
&itti ”litttttltttltelt {llllrtl¹httt¹lttttlt¹tltll
ιιιυθ ιιιιιιιιιιιιιιιιιιιιῖιι
have no doubt that,a’s in the two latter casea, a certain proportidn of the
progeny would bc variegated in trees and shrubs, aa well as in herbaceous
planta. ‘l'he raising oi seedlings srorn auch accidental varieties-then, will

prove that they are not entitled to rank yith cultivated varieties or taces.
