‘l'he difficulty of being able to determine what is only ο variety, and what
may beranked aeas eeiee,is ably pointed out by Dr. Liudley,tn the fol-

qulehlly, this test, which is the only sure one, is, in practice, eeldom oapable
of being applied. The determination of what is a species, and what a
variety, becomes, therefore, wholly dependent upon external charactere, the
power of duly appreciating which, es rndicative of specillo differente, is only
to be obtained by experiente, and is, inall cases, to a certain degree, arbr-

of which, depending for a long series of ages upon permanent pemlurilies of
soil or climate, have been in a manner lixed,acquiring aconstitution and
physiognomy of their own. Such supposed varietaes have again intermixed
with each other, producing other forms, and so the operation hes proceedetl.
But, ae it isim suble, at the resent day, to determine which was tlte ori-

The secret of tlte great number of names of species which at present form
the bullr of names in our catalogues is to he found in what follows from the
same author: - “Thus it seerm that there ere two sorte of species: the one,
called natural species, determinedb the definition given above; aud the
other, called botanical species, depending only upon the external characters of
the lent. The former have been ascertained to every limited attente of
the latter nearly the whole pf systematic hotapy equsists. Inthis sensea

The difficulty of determining what isa species, en what is averiety, as
far as concerns plante of culture, may here be considered as dimiuished; but,
since itis aclrnowl ed by Dr. Liudley, that nearly the whole of eystematic
hotauy consiste of w at are called ‘⁸ botanical s ecies,‹lepeudiug only upon
the external charactera of the plant,” the idea o determining, with any thing
like absolute certainty, what is aspecies, at least a botanical species, and
what is a variet t, seems almost hopeless. The “ whole question,’ Dr. Lind-
ley obecrvee, ⁸⁸ ies with the word essentinl. What is an essential character
ol‘a speeies? This will generally depend upon a proneness to vary, or ιο be
constantin particular c aracters, so that oue class of charactere may be
essential in one genus, another class iu another genus ς and these points ceu
be only determined hy experience. Thus, in the genus Dabla, the form of
the leaves ie found to be subject to great variationy the same species pro-
ducing,from seed, individuale, the forme ol whose leaves vary in a very strilr-

the fruit, or the surface of the leaves, and their serraturee, are found to he
generally fluctuating characters, and cannot often be taken ee mentiel to
species. The determination of species is, therefore, in all respecta, arbitrary,
and must depend upon the discretiori or experiente of the botanist. lt may,
neverthelees, be remarlred, that decided differencee in the forme of leaves, ru
tlre ligure of the stem, in the surface of the dili'erent parts, in the inflorescence,
in the proportion of parts, or in the form os the sepals and petuis, usually
constituta good specific differences.'' (ltu, p. 366,367.)
