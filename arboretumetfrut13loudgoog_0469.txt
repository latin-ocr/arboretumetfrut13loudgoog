'l'he subject of s ecles aud varietiea has, in our opinion, been placed in the
clearest light,by fessor De Candolle, in his Tfrc‘orie Elementnire, and in
his Phyrinlogr'e Ve'getnle. ln the latter work, this celebrated botanist recog-
niaes in plante-species, races, remanes, and variatione.

e Cartdolle unitas all those individuale which bear a sufficient degree of re·
semblance to each other, to induce us to believe that they might hare origi·
nated in one being, or one pair of beinga. The degree of resemblance which
authorises us to unite individuale under the denominatioa of a species varies
much in different familiee; and it often happens that two individuale which
really belong to the same species differ more between themselves in ap ear·

standing the thousande of varieties in cultivation throughoutt etamperate
regions of the world, and the immense diflerence between some of the varie·
ties (for example, the Alexander nr the Hawthornden and the original crab),

character consiste, in euch a manner aa to render it observable to any one
who hed not seen a great number of varieties of ap les aad crabs. Again,
in the case of the common hawthorn, though some op the varieties hare deep
red fruit, others pale red fruit, others yellow, and othere blaclt fruit; and
though some varieties of hawthorn have drooping branches, and others have

before us, inno one plantation, all those ashes which are nativas of America,
and watch thern for a sufficient number of years, we have rto doubt thet vwe
should not find it more difficult to asaign them to one speeies,than we
do the different venenas of the European ash to the Fraxinus excelsior.
All the elma of Europe, we are inclined to be of o inion,ma be reduced to

Recen- A race iu the vegetable as in the animal, kingdom, De Candolle
observes, “is such a modification of the species, whether produced by exterior
causes, or by crosa fecundetion, ua cau be uansmitted from one eneration to
another by aaedl' Thus, among all the cultivated regctables αυξτ fruita, both
of the gardera and of the field, the greater number of sorte may be considered
as moes, because they may all be continued by seed; the culture given and
other circumstances beingthe same. lf the culture were neglected for a series
of generations, there can be no doubt that the racc would revert to the abori-
