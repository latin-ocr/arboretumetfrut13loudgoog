however, that, if a great many seeds taken from the fruit of a jargonelle pest·
with variegated leaves were sown, some os the plants so raised would pro-

pendulous-hranched plante, hut to what extent it is im ossible to say. It
certainly would not take placeto such an extentas to conlhuud varieties with

white; otlier plante with hairy leaves, when grown in water, will have their
leaves smooth; and the hydrangea, grown in a certain description of soil, will
have its llowers blue: but, remove the plant with white leaves to the light,
and place the plant grown in water in dry soil, and the hydrangea in common
soil, and it wil be found that the leaves of the first will become green, aud
those oi the second bairy, and that the flowers of the hydrauges will resume
their natural pinkish hue.

Moles ond Hybrida. - Some confusion exista as to the use of these ternas,
when applied to plauts. 'l'he tenu mule, we think,ought to be limited to such
hybrida as are raised between different aboriginal species, and which it is be·
lieved are not susceptihle of propagation hy seed: such, for exemplans the
Pyros spuria, which seems ιο be a hybrid between Pyros Sdrbus or nna and
Pyros Chamaemespilus. Thetermhybrid,on the other hand,we think, ought
ιο be limited to the produce, bycross fecundation, of different races and varie·
ties of the same specics. Every one knows that this isone ofthe most im·

ortantelements of culture, having given rise to the most valuahle gardan
howers, table fruits, culinary vegetables, and agricultural planta.

Boionioal ὅμοιοι- It will be seen, from the preceding remarks, that we
follow De candolle in denominating what Dr‚ Lindley and other British bo·
tanists distinguish as botanical species, races, or varieties.

It is not to be supposed, however, that we undervalue botanical species, or

that we either deny the distinctuess of many that exist, or the (propriety σι’

having different names sor them, and keeping them distinct. othe con·
trary, to compare plante with men, we consider aboriginal species as ruere
savages, and botanical species, or, according¹ to De Candolle s classilication,
races and varieties, ss ervilised beings. W at, then, it moy be asked, is our
object in endeavouring to show that many of our botanical species are only
varietiee? We have two objecta in view; and both, we think, are very im·
portant ones. Iu the first place, hy confonnding varieties or garden or bota·
nical species with aboriginal ones, a beginner, ignorant of the extent to which
thiais done, cannot make a judicious selection3 and while, in the case Fraxi-
nus, forinstance (ol which there are, in roality, as we think, only three spe·
cies known, exclusive of o‘rnus), if he wished to select, perhaps, three sorta,
he might, instead of selecting¹ the three really distinct species, which would
give him a complete idea oft egenus, fix on three os the varieties ol' F. erue·
richna or ol F. excelsior, which would only give him an idea of one species.
In the second place, we wish to prevent beginners, in the study or cultivation
of trees, from puzaling themselves unnecesserily to make out the minute dif-
ferences which distinguish what are called botanical species ; belicving, as we
do, that it is impossible to make out many ol' these from the specilic charae-¹
