greatly beyond what is reall necessary. instead of this being the case, the
number of hardy trees an shrubs is so small, when com ared with that of

The mode by which we propone to attain these objecta is very sim le. We
shall retain the botanical speeies and varieties in the catalogues, so lhras we
believe them to exist ς but we shall, in every case, place before them the name
of the aboriginal species to which they belong: for example, in the case of the
genus marinus, which, in our Hortus Britannicas, appears to conaiat of 41

ecies and 12 varieties,we shall rank 30 of the speeies under the head of

.americiana, two of them under the head of F. lentiscifdlia, and the re·
mainder under the head of F. excelsior. lt may be asked, whether it would
not be better at once to make distinct genera of these three species? Το
which we answer, that it would not; because they are all so obviously of the
same general appearance, as evidently ιο belong ιο the same family. There
would be the same objection ιο separating the oak family into different
genera ; though we think it highly probabla that there are not a dozen abori-

varieties of Fraxinus arnerictina into one group, ιο distinguis them from each
other, than by leaving them as distinct species, and having the trouble of dis·

» tinguishing them, uot only from other rates or varieties of F. amaricans, but

also from all the races or varieties of F. excelsior.

Such are tha rinciples which we have adopted, to guide us in arran ing
species, races, autiJ varieties, from a perfect conviction of their truth. Ifwe
