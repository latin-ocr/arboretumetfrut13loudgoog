with differant botanical species of the same aboriginal species, and so oi
F. excelsior, we think it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to

One of the practices to which we allude ia, that ol describing species from dried

these gardens were to cooperate, and each to undertake the collection and

period, be able to say what are really species, and what are not. Il botanic
gardens were established in every country and elimate oi the world, and the
