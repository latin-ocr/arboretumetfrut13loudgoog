and cultivated, there will not, we may presume, be that desire, which now
seems to exist among botanists‚to increase tha number of species. Formerly,
and more especially among the disciples of Linnaeus, the eat business of the
botanist was to collect, name, aud describe planta. T ese were then the
highest departments of the science ς but, now, the anatomical, physiolo 'oal,
and chemical studies of plants occupy that station3 and the naming anffde·
scribing of species is considered as comparatively mechanieal.

The other cause which has contributed ιο increase the number of sup sed
s acies is, the natural erness of botanical collectore, ent abroad in or arto
recover noveltias, to fi something new, in order ιο answer the end for which

Tus large proportion which the ligneous vegetation of the earth’s sirrface

tirat trees and shrubs act an important part in the economy of our globe.
In countn‘es uninhabited by man, the influence of foresta must be on the
