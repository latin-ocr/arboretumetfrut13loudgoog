relation in which trees and shrubs stand ιο man. Itis not our intention to
enter farther into these subjecte here, then may be necessery to show to what
. circumstances, in the economical history of trees, we ought chiefly to direct

our attention, in composing the history of sech particular species. The
subject may be dirided into two sections.

Ιι appears highly probable that the greater pert of the surfece of our globe
has been, at one dms, covered with wood3 beccum, among other reasons, coel
is found in almost all countrieey et ell events, itis certain that this hae been
the cese with the part of the tem rate regions of the world et no very
distant period. orth Amedca was, ι’ lately, almost entirely covered with
trees and shrubs, and presented few neked eurfacee, except those of the allu-
vial deposita on the benlss of its lerger riserat and what was ιο recently the
state of Ameriae must, we may reasonsbly suppose, have once, at least, been
thet of every other ert of the world. ·

The influente which a predominence of forest must here in e country
uuinhebited by man must hare extended to the animale, the herbaceous
vegeteblee, the soil, the wetere, eud the climate. Το wild animale of er
kind, especially to those of the more ferociens description, foreste heve, in
oenotrios, furniehed shelter, and, in agraet measure, food : birds, inrecte, and
reptiles are the more common inhabitante of forest scenery. Herbeceous
planta ere, for· tha most part, destrpyed by dense foreets3 but some kinds, such

end branches of the trees. But the great influence of forest sceaery ιιι awild
etate is ⁰¹.¹ ‘the soil3 and, in this point of ιίιιι, natural foresta may be regarded

animale. It is unneceseary to show how the sorlrs furnishcd with thet organised
matter, on which alone perfect plante cen lire, by the decey of leaves, end,
ultimately, by the decey of trunks end branchee. The wetere of a country,
the rivers and lakes, ere necessarily affected by the etate of the woods of thet
country. These woods must, in all ceses, ect more or less eeasponge in
retaining the water which falls on them; and water must thus be supplied
more gradually to the dcere, in countriee covered with wood, then in countries
which are cleared, end regularly drained. The influence of forest scenery in
increasing the moisture of the etmos here, end in preventinge climate from
being so hot in summer, and so sold in winter, as it would otherwise be,is
well understood, and, in such e slight outline as the present, requires only ιο
be mentioned.

The use of studying the influence of trees in en uncultiveted countr is, to
afford useful hints with reference to the plenting or thinniug of em in
countries which are civilised. Thet which takes effect on a grand scale, where
foreste cover many thousand acres, must operate more or lese in the same
manner where the extend only to hundredo, οι even tens, of ecres; and, con-
sequently‚ this inhience must bc kept in view in the formation of plantatione,
both useful and ornamentel. If the foreste end plantatione of Britain ere no
lon rof such en extent es to efford a shelter for wolres end hyenae, they
stilleherbour foxes, polecets snare, and other noxious animale, end sevc-
rel kinds of omnivmous birds, euch es the hewlr. The foreste ln France
eud Germany still contain wolvcs and wild boers3 end, on most parts of
the Continent, the forestis the place of refuge to which men hies for con-
cealment after the commission of crime. (See Gentieri Dello lnflmro dei
Barchi, διο.) If foresta in a wild stete supply sood to birds and insects, in a
civilised country birds and insecta rney be expected to abound more or less
whcrever there arc trces and shrubs to supply them with food end shcltcr.
