The same may be said with reference ιο diberent species of reptiles. In Bel·
giam and part of Holland, the caterpillara oi some species of motha are so
abundant ιιι the woods at a particular aeaaon ever year, that it is a part of
the business oi the government police to see that they are destroyed. Hence
the advantage of knowing what trees aud shrubs are obnoxious to articular
insecta, and what insecta attach trees and shrubs generally. The to deeuuc·
tion of herbaceoua planta in dense foresta teacbes us, that, where wewish the
grass or other herbaga under trees to thrive, we muatplant the trees thinl 3
and the influeace os the decay of leaves, branches, and trees, in adding to e
soil, teaches ua how barren soil may be improved b trees; and thia natural
effect has been imitated by trenching down entire piantations of Scotch piae,

beries near dwefflnghousen and, more especially, ιιι planti such aa ara

trees and shrubs about a house, more especially in low-situations. There is

From trees and shruba in awild state we cau only truly learn their aboriginal
naturas y because planta, like animala, begin to change their habits aa soon aa
they are talreu into cultivation. The fact that thia change takes place ought
ιο be borne in view, when speaking ofthe native cadsand situations oi different
speciem because, if itis desirabie to im rore these species,it may be necessary
or advantageous‚ for that pur ose, to piace them in a different soil or situation
iram that in which they are iirurm in awild state. There are certain soils and
situations, however, in which planta are found in a wild state, that can hardly
be improved by art ς these are peat boga, or peaty soils, auch aa are found in
North America, and in alpina situations. We mention these particulare merely
as a lew, among a great number, to which attention ought to be directed in
