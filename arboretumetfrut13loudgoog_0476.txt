ln the three preceding chapters we have treated of the science ol trees, aa

pictorial objecta, or parts ol general scenery3 as organised beings, or botanical
objects; and 88 foresta or plantatione, influencing the physica] circumstances
ol 8 country, and the condition ol man. Our object in those chaptera was,
tn give a general idea of the extensive nature of the study of trees; and in
the present chapter we propose to enumerate 811 the particulari which require
to be talien into consideration in giving the specilic 8118888188, description,
history, 8ηά uses of each individual species, racc, or variety. These parti-
culars, arranged in the order in which they will stand in the succeeding part
of thia work, are aa follows :-

1. Clorn'ficati'on. We shall adopt the natural system, chiefly for the sake ol
aiding us in generalising on the genera 8ηά species which each order and
tribe containsy and we shall reler, sor the definitione cl these orders
and tribes, to the writin of Professor De Oandolle and Dr. Lindley,
and more especially to t e Prodrcmnt ol Dc (landone, and Lindley’s
