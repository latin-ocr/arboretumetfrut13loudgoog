4. Eagravings. Engravings of certain species vaud varietiea to a scale of
two inehes to a foot, with the flowers and other parts which are less than
an inch in diameter of their natural siae, are 'ven alon with dre text.

A. Eagrast'n ι qsthe Theca onlyare given in e platea ulrich form a separate
volume. lte cagravings in these lates are of three kinds: firstthere is
the general ligure of the tree,after in ten years planted in theclimateof
tlte environs of London, to a scale ol one fourth of an inch to a foot.
Secondly, on the same plats with the entire trec, are given mgravings of
botanical specimus in ower, and in fruit, with the winter's wood in the
case os deciduous trees, to a scale of itin. to rft; and, when the honera
or fruita are smaller than an inch across, they are given of their natural
aize. Thirdly, engravings of full-growntrees of a number of the species

ardy trees during that perio , in agiven soil and situation ; and the use
of the portraits of full-grown trees, all of which are talren from indivi-
duals within ten miles of London‚ is to give a palpable idea of the mag-
nitude and general figure which the particular cies assume, when full

growth, and the botanical specimens gaen alongrwith thern, are always
referred to as plates; while the engravings of those-species and verlatica·
which are given along with the text are referred to aa figures.

B. Pictorial Signa. At the commencement of each genus, or sectional
division of a genus, will be placed a pictorial sign, or signs, indicating
whether the species to be described are trees or abraba, deciduous prever-

5. Detmipliom.

Α. Πεισιφίὶιε Detn'b. These will commenta with tha root, aad proceed
indhfre order of stem, leaves, stipulas, inflorescence, bracteas, dovera,
an urt.

a. The Roct will be considered in regard to figure, quality, substance,
berk, duration, direction, rootlets, fibres, spongioles, susceptibilittp of
producing buda when made into cuttings, liahility to throw n su ers
naturally, magnitude relatively to aget soil, native habitat an artifimal
location; impulsion, or when it is in most vigorous growth; and hiber·
aetion, or when it is in a state of rest.

b. The Stem will be considered in regard to its figure, direction, duration,
articulation, surface, barlr, ramilication, branchea, branchlete, twigs,
height relativel to age, native habitat, and artificial locality. Ι

c. The haser w' bc viewed with reference to their vernation, internal
stmcture,figure, articulation, insertion, circumscription (that is, outline,
base, and apex), surface, subface, venation, direction, colour, texture, and
duration. The Petiole will bc considered as to its absence or presence;
and in the latter case its form, surface, texture, length, breadth, vari·
ation, duration, dte.

d. The Str'psder will be considered with reference to position, textina, aur·
face, insertion, figure, magnitude, and duration.

ε. The inflorescence, or mode in which flowers are disposed upon a plant,
will be examined aa to its kind and position.

s. The Bructeos will be examined under conditione similar to those pre·
acribed for the leaves.

gs The Flower will be considered in regsrd to first appearance, first ex·
pansion‚ colour, magnitude, length of time it continues expsnded
beforc it begins to fade, whether the flowcring of the whole plant is
