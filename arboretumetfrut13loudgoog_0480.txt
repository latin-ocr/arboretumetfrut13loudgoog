D. decidente. Some trees and shrubs are more liable than others to be
blown down, or have some ol their b nches broken off by high winda, or
by the weight of snow3 and these sp ies should be pointed out ιο the
inexperienced plantet. Some, also, are said to be less liable to be struclr
hy lightning than others; for example, the beech.

7. Geogrophc'ccl Distribution. The different countries will be mentioned where
each species is found naturally3 and, where practicable, the different lo-
calities, soil, elevation, and other particulare wal he given. lt will also be
stated, as sur as is known, in what countries each species is cultivated, and
to what pu es it is applied.

and respective.
A. lte-nemetae Hbtory of every species or variety will commence

with trs first discovery, or record hy ιοιοιιὶοιος and its progress will be
tracetl in every countply, but more especiallp io Britain, from that period
to the present time. hongh the history ο some trees and shrubs com·
mances with the time of the Romans, yet that of others is comparatively
obscure; and, ot* some ol the finest ornaments of our gardens, little more
can be stated than that they are raeee or varieties, perhaps hybrida, raised
by cultivators whose names are unknown.

B. The Prospectt've rintorp, »οι probable progrets, ol our knowledge ot*
speeies may be included under the heads of doubtful species, unnarned ·
species, and expected additions.

a. Deabtfm Spectet. ln almost every genus, containing several species,
there are some of the names which are of doubtftd plication‚ which
under this head we shall bring together, with their au orities, in order

· ιο direct the attention of botanists and cultivators to the subject.

b. Unnomed Species. The introduction of new species os trees end
shrubs into British gardensis constantly going on, and numbers are also

ἱ aa constantly being raised from seed in the country. ln general, neither
of these kinds ol additions ιο our ligneous flora can he received into
books till they have flowered; when they are named, figured, and re-
corded in some botanieal worlr. lt osten happens, however, that the

us to which a new plant belongs is discovered, frorn the general
liubit of the plant, long before it has flowered3 and in such a ease,
though the species may not be introduced into botanical catelo nes,
planta of it may be distributed arno cultivatora by those who ve
introduced it, and it may be propagate for sale in the nurseries, under
some provisional name. Such species, and also vaiicties raised in the
