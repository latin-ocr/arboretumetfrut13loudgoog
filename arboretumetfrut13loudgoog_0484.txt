Β. Commere'al Stathticr. Treee aud shrube are objecta os commerce: in'
their young state, aa plaute, and iu their more matured atate, es timber,
seucewood, fuel, harh, leaves, fruit, soeds, dcc.

a. Nat-my Commerce, cosma aad foreign. Some trees and ahruhs,

lrorn being iu little demand, are acarcey known out of private gar·
dens, or public botanical establishmeuts3 others are cultivated in the
nurseriee, some very generally, aud others only partially. Under
the head ol commercial Stetistics‚ we shall notice whether the ape-
cier is cultivated only in sorne nurseriea‚ or generally3 aud we shall
give the prices of planta ol the smallest siae fit lor heneplanting and
also of sceda when they are to be procured τ in London 3 ro the exten·
sive nurseries of Messrs. Baumann at Bollwyller ou the Rhine, asa
situation ceutral t'or Frauce, Germany, Switaerland, and Italy; and
in New Yorlc, aa a central situation lor North America.

b. Gamo Commerea, domme and ybrcign. Under thia head it willbe
our object to notice such trees,or their producta, aa arein general
transfer in the internal commerce of the country; and such, also, as
are exported or imported. Some woods, aa the plne, fir, oak, elur,
dte, are in general commarca ; and so, also, are some other products,
euch as oalc barlr3 but the timber of the spiudle tree and t elabun-
uum, the inuar berk of the holly, and tha {lowen of the elder bush,
enter into the courmerce only οξ particular places. What we shall
distiti* bilbili ttttttd‘fttlt tttmt‘titit‘tt
ppepnperatp climatee; thetis, to those spectes which are described in

rs wor.

’ Such is the berra idicl ol the desiderata which we intend to keep in view,
when describiug each species; hut we by uo means biud ourselves to have,
in our descriptione, a separate heading for each of the paragraphs in this
Chapter3 on the contrary, it will generally be found, that all that we have to
say respecting each species will be included in the paragra hs entitled, Iden-
trficolion, Synonymec, Deaiaalion, Engraainga, Spccs‘fic t' rccter, Varieties,
Description, Geography, History, Propertiea ond Uret, Soil ond Simiou,
Propagction aad Ocellare, decidente and Diaearca aad Statislict.
. All the matter included under the first lour headings, aa being of less iute-
reat to the neral reader, we have placed in small type, in order that it rna
seu tt satsat tta'thttwutttttz illitati
lating to species which have not been aeen by us ; and also to those which are
only hall-hardy, and require either to be planted against a conservative wall,
or otherwise to receive some kind of protection during the most severe
westher in winter. We have done this, though we consider what relatas to
the species which require some protection, as lilrely to prove oue ol the most
interesting parts of our work to many gardeners and amateurs (lor what
would the enjoyments ol gardening be, without the elegant cares of exotic
culture l), in order that those who talce an interest only in hardy trees and
ehrubs may distinguish‚ at a glauce, what belongs to them.
