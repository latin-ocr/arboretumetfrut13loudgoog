Tnsesand shrubs,in common with all other perfect lents, ιιι arranged by
botanists in two grand divisious3 viz. the Exogenous, or iiotyledonous, plante,
the stems ol' which increase from without; and the Endogenous, or Monocoty·
ledonous, plants, the stenis of which increase from within. The first class in·
cludes sll the hardy trees end shrubs in Britain, with the exception of shrubs
of the genere Yr'tcca, similer, Rfiscus,snd one οι two others; end this circum·
stance, ss well ss the lect, that the trees end shrubs of Britain ιιι comprised
ιιι ι very few orders and tribes, hes determined us to neglect the great
scientific divisions of the natural system, end to ndopt only those of the orders
snd tribes. We proceed‚ therefore, with the orders of the natural system,
much in the seme series es that in which they ιιι leid down in De Candolle's
Prodromur, Don’s Miller’r Dictiorrary, end in our Hortus Britannicum, giving
the orders aschemere, end the tribes es sections, end including in surdis·
tinctive character of eech order, the characteristic oi the division to which it
belongs: thetis to se ,fwhether to Dichtemydeae Thalnmiflbrae, Dichlemideae
Oslycifldrae, Dichlemideae Corolliflhrae, or Monochlempdeoe.

diagnostic, or distinctire character, of the orderis thus given by Dr. Lindley :-
‘⁴ Polypemlour dicotyledons‚ with hypogynous sternens [thet is, sternens under
the pistil]; authent bursting by longitudinsl slits3 several distinct simple cer·
pella [fruits]; exstipulete leaves, sheething st their bese3 solid albumen3 eud
seeds without erillus.” (Introd. to the Nat. Syrt, p. 6.) t

climate, and to be ecrid, ceuetic, end poisonous, though the root ol the peony
is said to be antispesmodic. All the plsnts of the order, with the exception
