sion of the root, by grafting, by summer budding, by layers, by cuttings, and
by single winter huda.

Seedn. These are occasionally ripened by planta bearing single or semi·
double dovera. Mr. Cmtis finds that seeds are reduced by P. M. papa-
verlcea in abundance. Iu England, plante were hprat raised in this way from
P. Mpapaverdcea, at Arley Hall‚the aeatof the Earl of Mount Norris. They
have since been raiaed at merel other places, and, among thece, at Glaaen·
wood, where the seeds are sowa aa soon as gathered in the autumn, and while
some of them vegetatein the following spring, many of them remaim year
or more before they come up. At Hinchinghrook, it was found that the seeds

describe it. When the wounds made are large, it may be adviaahle to sear
them, or to cover them with grafting wax. It is necessary, for the success of
each divided portion of the main root, that some lihrous roots should be
attached to it when taken off.

Grajliag. This operation is performed on the r'oots of herbaceous peonies,
at any time from the beginning of September to the middle of March. Select

the diamnce of half an inch from the centra of each bud, both above and below
it, cut out entirely round the atem a small ring of the hark, rather more than
the sixteenth of an inch wide, in the manner of 'common ringing, aa practiacd
on fruit trees. Thus ever bud will occupy one inch of the stem, where the
direct continuation of the k is obstructed, both above and below, by the

lai horizontally about 3in. beneath the soil, leaving only the leading bnd at
the eud of each brancb above the surface. ln six months every bud will have
made a vigoroua shoot, and, in general, will have two radical fibras at its base.

made roots, carefully separate ecch young shoot from the main layer, hypass·
