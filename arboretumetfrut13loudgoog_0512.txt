Description. A large shrub οι· low tree, with athick branchy stem, attaining
the height ol 20 n. or npwards in its native country, but seldom appearing ol'
hals that height, even in conservatories, iu England The leaves are large,
somewhat like those of the common laurel but smeller, lanceolata, thiuly dis·
tributed on the lower parts ol' the sboots, but closer together near their points.
The wood is hard, and finely scented, but fragile; and the barli is smooth,
and suaset-coloured. The fruit is composed ol’ from 9 to la sules (carpels)
united at their base, aud spread out at their extremities in the orm of a star.
Every carpel contains one ovnl seed, lance-shaped‚ aud of a rasset colour,
which encloses a whitish kernel, somewhat oily, and agreeable to the teste,
which is similar to that of the snise seed, but is more pungent. The sboots
grow at about tbe same rate as those of the preceding species, and the plant
sttsins its ultimate siae of 10 st. or 12 st. in twenty or thirty years.

Geography and Histcry. lt is found wild in Chins and Japan, where it is
cultivated in gardens as a sacred tree, and also for its carminative and stomachic
gpglities. lt was first described by Clusius, and afterwards seen in Japan by
1,vsttslstuwwnsnsssssnlsswswsuus
Coumet, near Boulognesur-Men and rt ss now occasionall met with in the

een-houses of tbe principal botanic gardens of the middle and north of
· urope, and in the open ground of those in ltnly.

Propertler and Uter. The whole plant is stomachis and canninative‚ aad
it is used in the East both medicinally and in cooking. The Chinese chew
it aster dinner to promote digestim, and as a sweetener ol the¹ breath: the
.fflntb‘ttltlffiltllttl, hildilid& {li malelidi? llll
into Europe, under the name ol Obrnese anise, sor the urpose of flavouring
disbes, and making tbe liquor called arrhette de Bor nr. The Chinese
malie an infusion os tbe seeds with the roots ol ninsin (Slurn Nlnsr' L.), end
drink it, when they are fatigued, to reeruit their strength and resresh their spirits.
They also mix it both with coffee and tea, to improve the flavour. The cap-
sules and seeds are infused in water, and fermented, so as to produce a vinous
li uor, very much estcensed, and which the Dutch import under the name
oi anise arracln Kaempfer states that a branch of this plant, though not

isonous in isselt-if put into a decoction of the poisonons lish called by the
hisch ophlarer (a species of Tetrodon), incresses the violence of the poison
-and males it occasion death almost instantaneously. (Koemps. snm, fasc. v.
p. 883.) The wood, which is called anise wood, is employed in cabinet-work:
nnitrienses
which are graduated on the butside at regular distances. The powdei
is then ' hted at tbe ferther extremity of the tube, and, ss it burna regularly
and slow y, it is always the same time in hurning a given distance ς and the
watchman, when he sees by the graduated scale that the llame has reached a
certain point, rings a bell, thus l'orming of it a kind of pyrotechnie cloch.
„The Japanese and Chinese consider the trecas sacred: they burn the barli as
incense on their altars, and with tbe branches decorate the tombs of their
friends. §Thouim Dice. Agris.; Roy., Cosrs d’Agrs'c.)

Soil nn Situation as in tbe preceding species, os which this, as Thunberg
conjectures, is, in all probability, onlya variety. It is, perhaps, rather more
tender, and, therefore, should be placed in the warmest situation that can be
found, but where it will, at the same time, not be too much exposed to the
direct intluence of the sun during the hottest months.

The Proysagation and Culture are the sameas ol the preceding species.
Plants are to be met with, iu the principal London nurseries, at from 2⁸. 6d. to
δι. each; and at Bollwyller, where the price is 3frnncs ; in New York, ἒ).
