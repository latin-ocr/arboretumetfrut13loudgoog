are as large as those of an of the varieties, and they are produced

Other Varietier. 10 consequence 01 the great demand for thia species in the
nuraeries, many slight variations have been noticed by cultivators, and
named as distinct. 10 100 gardan of the London Horticultural Society are
the following namesz-M. ‚vera M. g. tonsilia, Μ. g. 0000110111 aaa,
M. g. rubiginrira, and some others.

Selertr‘m os Varietier. M. g. odorata deserves the preference for the mag·
nificence of its foliage3 and M. g. eronifarir, because it flowers early and
freely ; and because, from the fastigiata form 01 the trec, it is less liable
to be injured hya heavyfallof snow; it seems also to grow faster than

quently raised from American, French, or Italian, seedfflnd, hence, the
plants, though they grow srecly, do not flower for 20 or 30 years aller being
planted out. For this reason, when it is desired to have plante of the
Magnblia grandiflbra which will flower early, those plants which have been
raised b layers from flowering trees ought to have the preference; or the
lEumouth variety should be made choica of, because it is always raised horu
ayera.

Description. In its native country, the M. grandifldra is a tree varying from
60 ft. to 100 ft, or upwards, in height. According to Bartram, its head forms

seeu at a great distance. In Europe, except 10 some situations 10 Spain aud
Italy, and a few 10 100 south of England, the M. grandiflbra is chiefly to be
considered as a wall tree- There are standards 0111,10 the neighbourhood of
London, 01 20 or 30 years' growth ς 001 these are not common; and, on ac-
count 01 1110 snow breaking down their branches‚ the require protectior
during winter. The leaves vary from 910. to lft. in length, and froru 3iu.
to 4 rn. or more in breadth ; they arc always smooth and shining, and perfectly
entire on thc cd es. Tlrey bear a strong resemblance to those of the common
laurel (Cerasus aurocerasus) both 10 form and colour; and to those 01 1110

they are of a rusty brown underneath ; and one takes its name from this ap-
pearance, though it 00110010101000100010001101100011 and adulationes to seem

In Arnerica, the fiowers appear in Ma ;in England, seldom before Juue;
and they continue 10 some varieties t'l they are destroyed by frost. The
flowers are produced on the summits of the last year's shoots, and are
'from 6 10. to Sin, or even ruin, across. lt is remarhed by Collinson, of
the flowers of this species of Mugndlr'a, that, unlilre those of all the other

species are produced comparatively at once, anil last only a short time. The
odour ο1 the flowers lsexceedingly sweet, and overpowering to some when
near, though it is agreeable at a distance. The seed of the species has 10 only
one or two cases been ripencd in England; but it ripens occasionally in
'Italy and in the neighbourhood of Paris (Bonpl. Malarairoa, p. 54.); and
young plants are frequently raised from seed brought from North America.
