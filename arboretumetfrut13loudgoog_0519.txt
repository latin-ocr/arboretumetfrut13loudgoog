magnolia does not flower till June or July, its blossome are in no dlrenger of
being injured by frost; and, therefore, it requires no rojectin coping, or
covering of aqy sort, during winter, at least about london. Wbere danger

roots, and especially the collar and the stem, for tlh or 3li. above the ground.

Propagaticn, in the London nurseries,is generally affected by forming stoola

in cold-pits. The ahoots are laid dbwn in autumn, and require two years to
become sufficiently rooted for separation3 they are theu potted, aad kept in
