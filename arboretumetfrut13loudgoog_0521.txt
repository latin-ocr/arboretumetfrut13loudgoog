Varictica The only aboriginal varieties‚ is varieties they can be called (ior
they appear to be only variationsp, are, that which retains its leav'es during
the greater part ol the year, whic appears to depend upon the molsture of

the soil in which the plant grows, and which is called, 1n the nurscries, M.
glauca sempervlrens ς that which assumes more of the tree character, and

under surface ol the leaves somewhat silvery, and is accordingly named M.

’ξ M. glarica3lmrgr'jdlia Hert„ tte long-leaved glaucone Magnolia, is a
variety produced, as it is supposed, between M. tripetala and M.
glauca lt was originatcd in Belgium, and imparted into this country
by Mr. Knight of the Exotic Nursery, Kings Road, Chelsea. Itis
in appearance intennediate between the two s ies; and seems to
correspond with the M. longilblia of Pursh. T elcuves are elliptical,
acute at both ends, longer than those ol M. glabra Thompsonidna,
and resemblin those of M. tri erola, butthirlter, amabar, cndglaucous
underneath. lt is a yery handsome trec, and, supposing it to be that
described by Pursh, rt rs found rn Florida and Georgia. The flowers
are sweetsclented, and resemble those of M.glat‘1caThompsonirlna‚
