rnoss or earth, they may be preserved for several months. This species is
very hardy, and can withstand the most rigorous winters, when the summer

extent 81 country, it appears only in situations persectly adapted to its growth,
which are always shady, and, where the soil is deep, strong, and fertile. ln
the lower parts os South carolina and Georgia, it is found only near the allu-
vial llats which lie along the baalis of the rivers, and there it isaccompanied
by the Magndlie grandillbra, but never hy the Magndlio glauce, which is con·

History. This species of Magnblio was brought to England about 17⁵2, and
soon after it passed into ance, and was cultivated on the Continent generally.
ln France and Italy 11 seeds freely i and even in England, at Deepdene in
Surrey, sels-sown seeds have produced plents. It may now be considered as
the commoneat os all the m nolias ; because, though in point of beauty 11 18
not so popular as Μ. gran itldra or M. glarica, yet, as a peat soil is not
essential to it, it is more easily preserved.

situation sheltered and shaded. A situation exposed to the sun is injurious;
and, trained against a wall, the plant suffers extremely. Α sheltered glade, in
ashrubbery or wood‚ where it is sufficiently distant from other trees not to be
iig'ured by the roots, is the most desirable site.

Propagation aad Cultura. ln the numerica it is almost always propagated
by seeds, but sometimes also by la ers. ln either case the plants are liept in
pots until required for final transplhnting.
