Derniption. The general a pearanceof thia tree, hliebaux observes, greatly
reseinbles that ol M. tri a. The terminal arrangement of the leavesis
the same, and it is remar le that the two trees are almost always found
together. ln point of aiae, it exceeds the tt. tri ala, both in its leaves and

neral height; but itis seldom found higher an 35st, which exceeds the
hiighr ol the other bya sixth part only. The body ol' the troe is covered
with asmooth and ve white barli, by which, in the winter, when stripped of
its leaves, it is readilydisringuished bom lll. tripetala. Atthis season,alro‚ it
may be distinguished byits buda, which are compressed and eovered witha
solt and silvery down; whereas in M. tripetnla they are prominent and
rounded at the end. The leaves, in its native countr , are sein. long, and
sin. or toin. broad; and in vigorous planta, in Englandh they sometimes even
exceed rheae dimensione. They are borne on petioles, short io comparison
with the aize ol' the leaves,and areos an oblong oval shape, pointed at the
extremity, and cordilorm at the base: their colouris light greenabove, and

species, and the manner in which they envelope the unexpand leaves, are
interesting subjecta of observation, more especially when the leaves are
emerging from the bud. Tbe stipulas are large, and placed mainly upon

tiolea ol the leaves ; yet the office ostbe stipules borne by the petiole os any

two years. The year’s· shoots may then lie from l ft. to 2 it.; so that Ιιη ten
