otker Variets'er. The Magndlia acuminhtu being frequently raised from
seed, and the seedlings varying much in the siae οἲ their leaves, and iu the
presence or absence ol pubescente, both on the leaves andwood, it would
be easy to select several varieties apparently as distinct aa those above
mentioned. In the Goldworth Nursery, Wolung, Surrey, are some which
appear rnarhebly distinct.

Description. A deciduous tree, in its native counny, nonsummum
in height, with a straight trunlr, from aa. to tlt. in diameter; numerous
branches, and regularly distributed shoots ‘lhe leaves are from 6 in. to 7 in.
long, and from 3in. to lin. broad, upon old trees, but double that siae upon
young vigemus-growing plante. Michaux describes them as oval, entire, and
very acuminata ς but, ιιι the seedlings raised in Britieh nursenes, they are
found sometimes ovate, nearly orbiculata, and cordate-acuminata. Theflowers‚
which are bin. or 6in. in diameter, are bluish, and sometimes white, with a
lint of yellow. They have but a seeble odour3 though, as the prelar and

¹Geogruplly: The most northerly polilt ativrhlclr this tree r'listened is
Nragara, near the Falls‚ in lat. 43⁰. It ebounds along the whole mountamous
tractos the Alleghanies, to their termination in Georgia, over a distance os
900 miles. It is also common on the cumberland Mountains, which divide
the state of Tenuessee. The situations peculiarly adapted to its grovth, ae·
cording to Michaux, are the declivities os mountains, nerrow valle saud the
beaks of torrente, where the atmosphere is constantly moist, ani where the
soil is deep and fertile. ‘¹ At the distanoe of 40 οι 50 miles from these
mountains, either eastward or westward, the cuoumber trec ie met with only
accidentall upon the steep banlts of rivers, where the etmosphere is oon-
stantly relleshed by the evaporation from their snrsare. We may conclude
that this tree is a stranger to all the regions north of the river lludson, and
toall the Atlantic parte ol the United States, tothe distance of 100‚150,
and 200 miles from the sea; the nature ol' the soil, and the extreme heat of
the climate in summer, being utterly uptongenial to its growth. It is also
