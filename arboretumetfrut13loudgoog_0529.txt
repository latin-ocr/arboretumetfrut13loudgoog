Spec. Char. Deciduous. Leaves beart-sheped, aomewhat ovate or cordate,
acute, under surface tomentose, upper sursaoe smooth. Petale 6-9, ob-

Howera white and purple, scented. JuneandJuly. 1800.

Demophon. This trec, in its native country, attains the height of tu st. or
50 ft, with a trunk la in. or minin diameter, straight, and covered with a
rough and deeply iurrowed bark. Its leaves, which are borne upon petiolcs,
are inam hin. to oin. in length, and from 3in. to bin. wide, smooth and
entire. The tlowers, which ap ear in April, ars yellow, with the interior os
the petal longitudinally markeri with several reddish lines. They are from
din. to tin. in diameter, and are succeeded by fruit about sin. long, and
nearly 1 in. in thickness, of a similar lorm to those ol' the preceding species.
The wood is light and soit, and is used in joinery and cabinet-making, where
it can be found; but the tree is not common in America. In Britain, the trec
attains the height of 20 ft. or ³0 st, and flowers iraely.

Geography. Found on the banks os the river Savannah, in Upper Georgia,
and on those oi the streame which traversa the back parta of South Carolrna.
The nearest point to the sea at which the younger Michaux found it, was in
the plantation oi Goodreat, la miles from Augusta, along thesides of Hom
Greek. The trec is rare in Upper Georgia, never making its appearance in
foresta, but only in isolated situations, along the banks of rivers.

Μ. acuminhta The soil and situation may be consi ered the same as in the
preceding s ies ς bnt, aa this rece or variety seems, in its native country, to
mhabit hig er and drier localitiea than M. acuminlta, it may probably be
placed in still more exposed situations than that species in Britain.

&sibliae Though this species is by no means uncommon in British gar·
dens, ve are not aware of many large ppecimens oi it. The highest we know
of is at claremont, where it has attam the height os 27 st. in sandy loam on
clay. At Luscomhe,-in Devonsbire,there is a trae 8 years planted, which has
attained the height of 14st.; and at West Dean, in Sussex, is one 9 years
planted, which is last. high. At High Clere,in asituation u wards of 500 it.
above the level of the sea‚a lant la years planted is 12 li. sigi. In the Perth
Nursery, one 8 years plantei is 15 s. high againsta wall. There are trees as
standards at Oriel Temple, Terenure, Charleville, and various other places in
Ireland At Paris, there are trees at Sceaux, and in most of the nurseries and
botanic gardent. Planta, both seedlings and layers, are not unsrequent in the
numerica. The price, in London, is from 'la sd. to tls. 3 at Bohwyher, 6 francs 3
in New Yorlt, 1 dollar.
