Geography. This species peers to be confined to a particular part of the ι
Alleghanres, nearly 300 ιιιίΙοιᾝοιιι the sea. lt is found on the steep haulis ol
the rivers which nse in these lofty mountains. lt appears to he very sparin ly

in such situations, is contrnurdly charged with moisture, from the nurnhcr oi

ffirtory. 'Ihis tree was discovered by Butr'arn, from whom it was first
received in England by Messrs. Loddigcs, in 1786. It was, probably, soon
Mterwuda sent ιο France; because we find Madame Lemonnien the widow os
Michaux’s mon and friend, describis atres of this species in her den ln
1800, which was oft. high, and had imdy flowered. As itis o difficule

propagation, it isnot ve generally distributed; but it is found in the prin·

cipal hotanic gardens ol Ma middle of Europe, and in first-me nurseries.

and doep3 and tbe situation low, sheltered, and moist, rather tban dry. As

seeds are not very easily procured, the common mode of propagatiou is hy
