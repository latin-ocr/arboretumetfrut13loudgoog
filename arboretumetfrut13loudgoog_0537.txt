sele as ι flowering shrub, but as a stock for grafting other speclea on, even
of the trec kinds: such as M. conspicua, cordate, and others. ln the north
of France, and in Germany, it is geneally treated as a green-house plant.
Soil oud Siluotion. This species is generally considered as requiring a mix·
ture of heath soil, or sandp peet,w1th loam3 but in many gardens about

London it succeeds perfect y both in send and clsy; the latter soil being
rendered free by sand, leaf mould, or manure, and manage. The situation,
when the plaut is treated as a bush, ought to be open, in order that the wood
may be ripened; aud the plant should be detached, it order that it tnay be
covered with foliage end blossoms on ever ¹ side. North of London, in most
situations, it requires ι well, and few p ts are more deserving of one.
Agarnst a wall, it will resch the height o 15 ιι. οι 20 ιι.

Propagation anet Cadere. In the London nurscries, it is generally propa·
geted by layers; but it will also strikc by cuttin , both of the ripened and
the herbaceous wood. The stools are geu y formed in pits; or, ifin
the open ground, they are nerally covered with mats duri winter. Scede
have been ripened both tn kkgtmd and Francet and from kiae lenta have
been raised m some few nurseries. The plante, whether raised ιιοιιι layers,
cuttings, or soed, should always be ke t in pots till wanted for final planttng.

Stabatict. There are fine plants olpthis species, trained against walls, ιι
Harringay, Wonnleybury, White Knights‚ and numerous other laces.
The largest bushes in the neighbourhood of London are in the Mile End
Nursegp3 and there are very handsonre specimens in the Hammersmith Nur·

Description. ln its ιιιιιιι country it is ι small trec with rough hark; but
in England it is a somewhat delicate shrub‚ with slender stcms and branchos,

The young leakcs are pubescent ιιιιιιιιιιειιιι, ιι ιιι the young shoots. ln
England, though this kind cannot he considered ss ι trec. et it has ι
different habit of growth from M. purpdrea; and, instead of, l' eit, forming
ιι broad spreading buch, it is a narrow, upright‚ slendcr, fasti ' tte-growing
one. The berk has the ame odour as that of M. purpurea. Ἰἰυ1 two main
points of difference between it and M. purprlrea are, the paler green, and
somewhat narrower shape, of the leaves3 and the longer and more slender
form of the flower, the points of the petala of which are slightly turned
back; while the flower of M. purpdrea is more cup-sheped, and the petala st
the points are rather turned inwards. The petala of M. grhcilis are exteriorly
of an entirely dark purple, whereas those of M. purpdrea melt off into white
ιι their upper extremitics.

Geo uphy, Hr'slory, dc. Itis a native of Japan, where it is said by
Kaemp er to attain the siae of a cherry trec. It was brought ιο England ιιι
ιὸθι, but ιι not very common, probably from its being very generally con-
foturded with M. purpurea. ιιι management, in all respecta, is the same ιι
that of the species, except thet it is, perhaps, sornewhat more tendet.
The largest plant that we know of is in the conservatory ιιι White Knights,
where it forins a nerrow bush about ton. high. It is kept in the conser-
vatory there, not οιι account of its tenderness‚ hut because ιι was considered
to be a conservatory plant when it was first planted; and ιι ιι now much too
