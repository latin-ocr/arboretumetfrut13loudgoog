seeds are unproductive ς aad that, on large trees, the seeds from the
highest branchos are the best. The bavit, till the trualt exceeds vin. or 8 in.

depth of the furrow, and the thickness of the barli, are proportioned to the
aize, and to the age of the tree. The beart, or perfect wood, of the tulip
tree is yellow, approaching to a temon colour3 arrd its sap, or alburnum, ia

aoil; which, in some parta, is too dry, as in the pine barrem, and in others
too wet, as in the swamps which border the rivers. Even in the middle aad
western states, the tulip tree is less abundant than the oalrs, the walnuts,
the ashes, and the beeches, because it delights only in deep, loamy, and ex-
tremely fertile soils, such as are found in the rich bottoms that lie along the
rivers, and on the borders of the great swamps that are enclosed in the
foresta. In the Atlantic states, especially ata considerable distance from
the sea, tulip trees are osten scen to ft, stt ft, and 100 ft. in height, with
trunks from lein. to attin diameter: but the western states seem to be
the natural soil of this magnificent tree, and there it displays ita most power-
sul vegetation. It is commonly found mingled with other trees, such as the
melones, the black walnut end butter nut, the Kentucliy coffee tree (Gym-
ndcladus), and the wild cherry tree: but it sometimes constitutas, mone,
