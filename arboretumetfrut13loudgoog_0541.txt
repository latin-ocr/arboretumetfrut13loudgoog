The lirst notice which we hare ol tlie tulip tree on the Continent is in the
Catulogue of tlte Leydeii Gradere, published in irai. From the number oi
tulip trees existiug in Franco, the south oi Germany, and Italy, there can be
little doubt that it s read aa iapidly in those countriea as it did in Britain.
Public arenues are planted of it in Italy, and as l'ar north as strasburg and

Metz. It stands the open air at Vienna, aud attains a large site there; but
it will not endure the apen air north ol Warsaw, or at Moscow, without pro·
tection. The first tulip tree which lloweied in England was one in the cardena

light woods, is yet, Michaux observes, much hearier than that οἰ the common
poplar3 its v n is equally fine, but more compact; and the wood is easily
wrought, angrpofim well. It is found strong and stiff enough sor uses that
require great solidity. The hesit-wood, when separated hom the sap, and
perfectly seasoned‚ lon resista the influente of the air, and is apid ιο be rarely
attached by insecta. lta greatest defcct, when employed in wide boords, and
expiosed to the westher, is, that it is lisble to shrinlr and warp, by the alter-

being allowed sufficient time to be pro rly seasoned. The nature ol' the
soil has so striking au influence upon thld oolour, and upon the quality of
the tulip wood, that the mechanica who emplopit have made the remedie
