oumstances in which it is placed. in deep rich soil, the wood is yeiiow aad

hard, and deca s more readily than the wood which has grown on rich soil.
According to u Hamel, it neither thrives in France ou a dry and gravelly
soil, nor on one with the subsoil of clay or marl. The most id-growing
young tulip trees which we have heard of in England were plant in a deep
sandy lesui, iu a rather meist climate, in the Wcst Riding of Yorltshiret and
the progress of these bas been at the rate of io ft. in io years, from the seed.
(See Gara M ., vol. iri. p. 250.) The situation most favourable for the tulip
tree is one whic , while it is sheltered from high winds, is, at the same tiine,
sufficiently exposed to the light and air to admit of the matiiration of its leaves

in autumn, they generally corne up the following spring3 but, sown in spring

be much attached by insecta.
