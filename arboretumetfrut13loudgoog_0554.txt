The species are generally thorny, arrd most os them flower sreely in spring,
bearing fruit abundantly m autumn.

ticulnrly of those of the common berberry, of B. cenedensis, B. sinenda,
and, thaps, of all thes ies the flowers of which etipsud, is a very
remar able property, whic was first discovered by Kiilreuter; probably
from observarig that the stamens were put in motion b the proboscisol
insecta extractrng boney from the flowers. Sir lamec dward Smith has
given a copious account of thia phenomenon in the Pttt ilum„ vol. lxxviii.
p. 158, and the last, 8ηά most clear end concise, description os it will
be found to be that by Dr. Lindley, under the article Bdrbeir, in the Pemr
Cycbpoeds'a. The sternens, “ when the filamont is touched on the inside wi
the int of a pin, or any other hard instrument, bend forward towards the
pisti , touch the stigma wath the anthat, remain curved ior a short nme, and
then partially recover their erect position. 'l'bis is beet seen in warm dry
westher. Aster heary rain, the phenomenon can scarcely be obscrved,
owing, in all probability, to the {punga of the filaments having been already
setin motion by the dashing ol' erainu n them, orto the flow having
been sorcibly struck against each other. he cause of this curicus action,
like that os all other vital phenomcna, ie unknown. All that has been ascer-
tained concerning it is this, that the irritability of the filament is affected
differently by different noxious substances. It hasbeen found by Messrs.
Mncaire 8ηά Marcet, that, if a berberry is poisoned with any corrosbe agent,
such as arsenio or corrosiva sublimate, the filaments become rigid and brrttle,
and lose their irritability3 while, on the other hand, if the poisoning be affected
by any narcotic, such as prussic aoid, opium, or belladonna, the irritability ia
destroyed by the filarnents becormn so relaxed and flaccid‚ that they can be
easily bant in any direction. lt is fficult to draw from this curicus sart any
other inserente than this, viz. that in plante, as well as in animala, there rs
something analogous to a nervous principle, which is more highly developed
in some plante, or in someo ns, than in others.” (Pers. Cpr„ iv. p. 260.)
According to Sir J. E. Smith,t e purpose os this remarkable unction in the
stamens of the berberry is evident. “ ln the original position ol' the atumem
tlte anthera are sheltered from rain by the concavity of the petals. Thus,
probabp', tbey ramniu till some insect comes to extract boney from the base
of the owers, and, thrusting itsell' between the filaments, unavoidably toucbes
thern in the most irritable art; and thus the im regnation of the muns is
performed.” (Pru. Tium.,ixxviii. p. 158.)Ι All die species areeasil propa-
