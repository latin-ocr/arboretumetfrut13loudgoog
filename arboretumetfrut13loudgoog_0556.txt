Geogrnphy and History. Found wlld in most parts of Europe, and in many
parts ol Arna aad Ameriea3 in the warmer parts ol those last countriee, on
mountains; in the colder parts ol Europe in lains, as in Norvray, near Chris-
tiania. The berbery is found on Mount Le on, and on Mouet Etna; in
which last situation it becomes a low shrub, in the last tone ol vegetation, ιι the
height of 7500 Freuch leet above the level of the tea. In England it is found
in mdigenous woods and hedges, more especially on salcareoue soils. It is
ao common in the ves of Saffron Walden, in Essex, where corn grows fre-

as a proof that the prejudice reqweting its o ' 'nating the mildew on wheat is
unfounded. It is iudigsnoua in Scotland an Ireland, but not very common
in those countries. The plant is mentioned byPliny; and, among moderna,

by all the writers on planta, under different nantes, till the time of Ray, who
first called it Bbrberhr which name was allerwards adopted by Linnaeua, and
by all the botanists since his time. '

in his time “ ιο reason meat with, and histesd of a saled, like sorrel.” The
beriles are ao aoid, that birds seldom touch them. They are not caten raw,

shown that the mildew which attacks the berberry (AEcldium Berbdridia
Pera, fig.47.) is quite different from any of the Ftingi which are found on
