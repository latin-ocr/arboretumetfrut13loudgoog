fully exposed to the mid-day sun, are essential. it should either be planted
against a wall, or ou tbe south side of dry elevated rockwork ς aud, iu either
case, itwill require some protection during winter. ln the Nouerca Du Home!
itis stated that it will not grow st all if placed iu tbe shade. Iu the neigh-
bourhood of Paris, it ia grown iu ligbt so' , on a suatum of broken limestone,¹
and protected duri winter with straw or leaves. There is a plant against
the wall in tbe Lo on Horticultural Society's den, which m 1835 had
stood thares ears with very little rotectiou. bere is a large aud vigorous
plant of it in tbe botanic garden at bamb· ,planted in the open air, but in

flowers abundantly every year.

Statafici. The caper is cultivated for its hints and buds ou botb shores of
the Mediterraneum and in Graece, and even in Egypt, the buda are gatbered
forsslefrom wildplants. In France, tbc only caper plantatione are in the
neighbourhood of Marseilles aad Toulon, and these have existed from the
time that Marseilles was founded byacolony from Greece. The lanta are
tbere grown in open fields, lanted at 10 ft. apert iu quincunx. eyattain
the height of 4 fi. or bii„ and the bush covers a space of about the same dia·
meter. Every autumn all the shoots are cut off within bin. or 6in. of the
root; and, over the stools so formed, a little heap uf earth is thrown up, of
from 6in. to 8iu. in thickness. In s ring this earth is spread out, and the
ground is hoed or plou hed ς and tiis is the whole culture which the plant
receives. As soon ss tbe planta begin to flowm, which, about Marseilles,is
early iu May, women and children ara emploped to gether the buda, and they

are formed into cuttings of about a foot in length, which are immediately
planted in a nursery, and covered with straw, to protect them from frost.
They remain there two years, aud afterwards are nansplanted to their final
situation, where two, and sometimes three, planta are always placed togetbcr
to provide for deficiencies from deaths. Sometimes new plantatione are formed

much ou account of the severity of the frosts theresa owing to the humidity
both of tbe situation and of the climate. In S ain, cn the shores of the Me·
diterraneau, the ceper is planted on the face ofterrace walls on the sides of
hilis. Bosc observes that the gatbering of tbe caper buds by women aud
children is a “ cruel tormeut” to thern, on account of the numerous spinea
which cover the brauchea ι aud he adds tlrat he has heard of a variety, which,
however, he says, is not lrnown in France, which is without spinos, and which
it would be very desirahle to substitute for tlte other in general cultivation.
