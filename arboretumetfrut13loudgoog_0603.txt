We may observa, here, that the rockwork ln the Chelaaa Botanic Garden
forms a sort os truncated cone, flattened on the sides, terminating in asmall
basin sor water planta ; and it suggests the idea theta helianthemum wall,
constructed sonaewhat on the santa plan aa the strawberry wall of Mr.
Byers (Gard. Mag, vol. v. p. 133), would be a vary suitable maranen of
growing the species.

leaves ovate oblong, obtuse; upper ones lanceolata, acute. Stipules linear,
ciliated, somewhat longer than the footstalks. Calyxea smoothish, but

Α splendid plant, with reddish crimaon flowers3 the petals imbricated‚ and
having a sntass orange s ot at the base of each. Ita native country is un-
certain, but it was in cuiiivation in the Fulham Nursery in 1836. Sweet
considers it aa havin the duhest-coloured, if not the handsoatest, flowers
os the geum The liowers are also, he says, very large sor the sizc of the

plant. It is nearly related to ll. rhodhnthum, hut is readily distinguished
frona it by its canescant leaves, end stronger habit of grovvth.

Petals imbricata. (Doa’r ml, i. p. 313.) A native of France and Spain,
and, according to vaeet, cultivated in British nurseries in 1829. Its
flowars are white, and of a delicate texture. , This aort, Sweet observes, is
generally found, in the nurseries, under the name os H. poliifdlium3 but he
thinks that it has nothing to do vvith the English species of that name.
For some reason os this kind,we suppose, it has been called the 11. confusum.
