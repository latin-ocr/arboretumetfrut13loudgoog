in every genua which now contains e great manywould soon be con·
siderebly reduced. The flowers of this kind of udsouia are small und
yellow, and appear from May to July. Like Η. Nuttdlli, this is' romewbut

Long as is the listof Cisthceae, aud especially of helianthemums, in this

so long a descriptive list, is, to show the numerous und beautiful forms assum

Supposing a cultivator about to form ι collection of tisticeoe, we should
