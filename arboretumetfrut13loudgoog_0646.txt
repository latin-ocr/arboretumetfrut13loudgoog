soit, naaman, ard general Monogenem. The camellias will grow in any
free soil, buta loam incliuing to saud, enriched with leaf-mould or thoroughly
rotten dung, seems to suit them best. Most of the species and venetias seem
to prefer a situation somcwhat shaded; which, as we have already ohserved,

’ seeum to be generally the case with evergreeu plants having broad shining
leaves. For this reason, an east or west wall, or even a north wall, inclining
to the east or west, will be found preferable to a south wall for the more
tender sorta ς and for those which are to be treated as bushes, a situation in
the shrubhery or arboretam, where they will he shaded by tall trees during
the hottest part of the day, is desirable. '

ative gardens arc to be placed together, the walls may be arranged in the form
of entagous, by which means, as in the cells of the honey-bee, no space would
be lost. Ι The form of the garden being either circular or pentagonal, and the
