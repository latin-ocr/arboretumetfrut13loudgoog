p The Tria viridis is sufficiently hardy to stand the air iii the neighbourhood

rio doubt os the hardiness of this species. indeed, it thrivee fer beuer in
the open air than in pots; probablg owing to ita constitutional habit oi
throwing down ita roots perpendicu arly to a great depth. The only con·
servatory in which we have seen it iii a pro erotis state is that at Cashio·
bury, iii Hertsordshiie, where the glasa roo is taken off during the grmei
part ol the year. The plant not only flowers freely in the open air, but
sometimes, as at Farnbain Caatle, it iipeiis seed. lt is easily propagated hy

ground, aaa hali-hardy shnib, may be considered tlie same as that ol' the
camellia; with thia differente, that, being more of a bush than that plant,

and lovin the shade still more, it does not seem to answer so well against i
