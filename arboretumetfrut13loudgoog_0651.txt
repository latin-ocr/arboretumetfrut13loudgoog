Description, dc. The hardy ligneous plants belonging to this order are all
shrubs or undershruba sub-evergreen or deciduous; with dotted leaves,
smooth, oblong, or lanceolata, and yellow flowers. They are nativas ol' Eu·
rope, North Ameriae, or Asia. Some few of Africa, but more of Australia.
Medicinally, they are bitter and slightl astringent: the solt parts of many
species contain a fragrant oil, and others secrete a yellow juice: from a
Mexican species the gum Squitum Gulla os commerce is produced. ln gar-
dening, these shrubs must be considered more aa flowering shrubs for dry bor-
ders, than aa woody plante of permanent duration in the arboretam οι
shrubbery. There are, however, oue or two exceptione. All the'species
throw up abundance ol' aide suckers, and are readily propagated by division of
the· plant, οι by cuttinga; and some of them n' en seeds. They will gron in
any soil, not too still, or too much charged witl moisture.
