Description. The species are chiefly low aud middle-sized deeiduous trees,
generally with lobed‚ but, in one or two cases, with entire or pinnated leaves.
They are natives ol Europe, North America, and the north os ndis. Theyare
all highly omamentaly some of them valuable for their timber; and from illaec

Geography und Histor- . ‘⁴ The maples,” Michaux observes, “ form exten—
riye foresta in the northern parts ol North America: these foresta ¹uppeur,
wrth those os the beech, to succeed the s ruce fir, the larch, and the pure, aud
to precede the chestnut and the oalr3 at least, this is the case between 43⁰ and
46⁰ os N. lat„ the region assigned by nature to tha true sugar maple.''
Seven species of rcer, end one of Negdado, are described by lllichaux. ln
the Pen. Gya, under the article noer, understood to be by Dr. Lindley¹
34 species are enumerated or descrihed; and, iu Don’r Miller 39 species,
ol which 26 are in cultivation in British gardens.

Most of the American species are already introduced into Britain3 hut
thereme some in the mountainoua regions of India, and probably in Japan
and China, which are likely to prove hardy iu Britain, which are not yet iu· ,
troduced, the names of some ol which will be found in p. 173.audp.1ra., Ι
and in the concluding sectron ol this chapter. '

Soil aad situation. The Acerdceae prefer a free, deep, loamy soil, rich
rather than sterile, and neither wet nor very dr . The situation that suits
them best ia one that is sheltered, and shady ra er than exposed. They are
seldom found on the north eides of losty mountains, or on mountain· stall,
except among other trecs; but in the plains they ara found by themselves.
Though the aperies only atteia perfectiori in favourable soils and situations,

they will spring up aud live in any soil or situation whatever.

Propagationandd'vdture. The Acerbceae are cbietly propagated from seadsr '

but some sorta are increased by layers, cuttings of the shoots or mou, ot by
budding or grafting. The seeds os most ol the species ripen in October, and
