· bees, and other insecta, that attend them. The tips of the wings of the
samarae os several of the specics are of a light red, in Erpgland, at the end

ous trees, natives of Europe, North Athenien, and, some, os the Himalayas.
They are, in general, quite hardy in Britain, aad most of them ripen seeds
in this country, hy which they are readily propagatori. They are among the
most ornamental trees of artificial plantatione, on account of the great
beauty and variety of their foliage, which changes to a fine scarlet, or rich
yellow, in autumn. The larger-growing species are osten many years be·
iore they come into flower, and, after they do so, they sometimes flowcr
several years before they mature secds3 probably srom having the flowers
