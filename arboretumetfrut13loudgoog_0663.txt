sited deciduous tres, 8 native of Europe, from Norvay to Switzerlsnd‚ and
also of North America, but not of Britain, floweringin May and June.
introduced in 1683. Height from 40 ft. to 70 fi.

Dermpnon. A handsome tree of the first rank ς in general appearance, at
adistance, like the common sycamore3 but, on a nearer ap rosch, the leaves
are found of a smoother and finer texture. The roots exten considerably both
downwards aud laterally. The trunk is somewhat shorter than that of the syca-
more, seldom excesdin 60 ft. or 70 ft. in height. The barlr is green on the young
shoots, but it afterwards becomes of a reddish brown, dotted with white points:
that of the trunk is brown, 8ηά rather crached. The buds are large and red
in autumn, becoming of a still darker red in the course of the winter: those
on the points of the shoots are always the largest. The leaves are thin,
green on both sides, aud shinin . When the petiole is broken an acrid millry
sap issues from it, which coagdates with the air. The leaves are about 5 in.
long, and nearly the same in width. The petiolas are longer than the leaves.
About the end of October, the leaves become either of a clear ora yellowish
red, aud then drop'off. The flowers appear just before the leaves, near the end
of April: they forma short raceme, somevvhat corymboae. The fruita, or
heys, have their wings yellow. They ripen in September and October; and
it rs not till the tree has attaiued the age of near y ll) years that it produces
fertile seeds, though it will flower many years before that period. The rate of
growtb of this species is considerable. n France,a plant has been known to
attain the height of 12 st. in three years from theseed. ln Englaud, when once
established, it produces shoots from le in. to 3 ft. long every year, till it at-
tains the height of 20 fi. or 30 ft, which, in favourable situations, it does in
10 years.

Description. The leaves are very slightly beart-sheped,irregnlsrl
toothed, 5-lobed‚ with the lobes more or less abru tly pointed.
The burk of the young wood striped, somewhat in the manner of
thatofrf. striatum; by w ich circumstance the plant, in a young state,
is reedily distinguished from Α. plataniiides. A large trec, native
of the kingdom of Naples, and found on mountains. The general
appearance is said to bc that of A. platandides, of w ich it
seems to us to be onlya variety. We have seen small plants of
this sort in the arboretum of hlessrs. Loddiges, and in one or two
of the nurseries. These vvere imported from Messrs. Booth, nur-
aerymcn, Hsmburg. They appear to be grafled on Α. platandides.

warrant us in recommending it for cultivation. From several spe-
cimens which we have seen, wc consider it as decidedly inferior in
,beauty to the variegated sycamore.
