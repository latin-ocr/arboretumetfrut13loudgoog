Propensior and Uret. ln Amerioe, in Vermont, New Hampshire, the dis·
trict of Maiae, and farther north, where the oak is not pleutiful, the timber
of the sugat maple is substituted for it, in preference to that of the beech,
the bisch, or the elm. When parfectly seasoned, which requires two or
three years, itis used 'by wheelwrights for axle trees and spolies, aud for

wholly of wood, sugar maple timber is used for the framework ; and in the dia-
trict of Maine it is preferred to the beech for the keels of vessels,as it furnishes
longer pieres: with the beech and the yellow pine it forms, also, tlte lower
heure of vessels, which is always in the water. The wood exhibite two
occidental forms in the arrangement of the fibre, of which cobbart-melers
take advantage for making beautiful articles of furniture. The first conabo

and sometimes several lines apart. The more numerous the spots, the more

highly prized. To obtain the finest effect, the log aliould be sawn in a direc-
tion as nearly as possible parallel to the concentrical circles. When catat
the proper season, the sugat mapleforms excellent fuel. Itis ex rtcd from
the district of Maiae, for the consumption of Boston, and is equul y esteemed
for that purpose with the hickory.

The ashes of the sugat maple are rich in the alkaline principle, and it may
be confidently asserted, that they furnish four listha of the otash exported
to Europe from Boston and New Yorlr. In the fo es of ermom eud the
district of the Maiae, the charcoal of this wood is pr erred to any other, and
it is said to be one fifth heavier than that made from the same species in
the middle and southern states; a fact which sufficiently evinces that this
upaple acquires its characteristic properties in perfection only in northern
cunetes. ,

The wood of the sugat maple is easily distinguished from that of the red·
tlowered maple, which it resembles in appearance, by its weight and hard·
ness. There is, besides, a very simple and certain test: a few drops of
salphate of iron being poured on samples of the different species, the sager
