mople turns greenish, and the white maple and the red-dowered maple
change to a deep blue. -

The extraction of sngar from the rnaple is a valuable resource in a new
country sbounding in forests of that tree, and without much foreign com·
memet but it is evident that this mode of obtaining angar is only destined
fora certain stage in the progress of society, and must, in Americs, very
shortly give way to the auger of commerce, produced by the cane; for this
reason,we shall give but a short account of the process of manufacturing
maple sugat, and this chiefly as a matter of historicel interest, rather than of
practical utility. ln America, wherever thereme canals and railroads, the
making of maple sugat must soon becom an unprolitable occu ation ·= ‘

The process of making maple sugsr is commonly begun in ebruary, or in
the beginning of March, while the cold continues intense, and the ground is
still covered with snow. The sap begins to be in motion atthis sanson, two
months before the general revival of vegetation. In a central situation,
lying convenient to the trees from which the sap is to be drawn, ashed is
constructed, called a sugar camp, which is destined to shelter the boilers,.and
tlte persons who tend them, from the westher. An eriget} of an inch in
diameter5 small troughs to receive the sap ; tubes of elder or sumach, Β in. or
ldin. long, corresponding in siae to thes er, and laid open for a part of
their length; buckets for em tying the treug s and conveying the sap to the
camp; boilers of 15 or 18 lons’ capacity; moulds to receive the syrup when
reduced to aprosser consistency forbein formed into cukes; and, lasdy, axes
to cut and split t e fuel, are the princip utensils employed in the operation.
The trees are erforated in an obliquely ascending direction, 18 in. or 20in.
from the ground, with two lroles din. or bin. apert. Care should be taken
that the angers do not enter more than half an inch within the wood, as ex-
perience has shown that the most abundent flow of sap takes place at thia
depth. lt is also recommended to insert the tubes on the south side of the tree.
The troughs, which contain 2 or 3 gellone, are made, in the northern states,
of the white pins, of white οι· black oak, or of ma le; but on the Ohio,
tlte mulberr ‚ which is very abundant, is preferred. The chestnut‚ the black
wrdnut, nn the buttemut should be rejected, as they impert to the liquid
the colouring matter and bitter principle with which they are impregnated.
Α trough is placed on the ground, at the foot of each tree; and the sap is
every day collected and temporarily poured into casks, from which it is maun
out to fill the boilers. The evaporation is kept up by a brisk lire; and the
scum is carcfully taken off during this part of the process. Fresh sap is
added from time to time: and the heat is maintained till the liquid is reduced
to a syrupy after which it is tert to cool, and then strained through a blanket
or other woollen stuff, to se urate it from the remaining impurities, when it
is poured into the moulds. lue bollers are only half filled;. and a steedy
beat is kept up till the liquor is reduced to the proper consistency for being
poured into the moulds. The evaporation is known to have proceeded far
enough, wben, upon rubbing a drop of the syrup between the fingere, it is
peccatved to be granular. If it is in danger of boiling1 over, a bit of lard
or of butter is thrown into it, which instantly cahnst e ebullition. When
refincd, this sugsr equale in beauty the finest consumed in Europe, but itis
used only in tbe districts where it is made, and there only in the country
places, as, from prejudice or taste, Michaux observes, imparted sugar is used
ιιι all the small towns, and in the inus. ⁰

The sap continues to flow for six weeks; alter which it become less abun·
dant, less rich in saccharine matter, and sometimes even incapable of crystal-
lisation. In this case it is consumcd in the state of molssses, or exposed for
three or four days to the sun; when itis converted into vinegar by the acetous
fermentation: a kind of beer is also made of it. The amount of sugar
produced by each tree in a year venes from different causes. A cold and
dry winter renders the trees more productive than achangeable and hurnid
sanson. It is observet, that, when afrosty night is followed by a.dry and
