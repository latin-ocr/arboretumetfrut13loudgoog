Gennany, Austris, and Italy, in wooded mountaruous situations. ln England,
it is found in hedges and about houses, but not truly wild, according to Smith;
though others consider it indigenous. Gerard, in 1597, says it is a stranger in
England, only sound growing rn the walks and places ol pleasnre of nobi-en,
where it ia planted l'or the sake os its shadow. Parkinson observes, ‘⁸ ltis

about noblamen's houses; hut says it began, in his time, not to he much in

falling leaves. Martyn,in his edition of Mdler’s Didiam, says that, is it were
truly indigenous, the country would have been full of it; since the trec comes
u with such wonderful sacility from the seed. For the same reason, Dr.
lialler supposes it to have been one ol the very earliest ol foreign trees intro·
duced into Scotland. Sir Τ. Ι). Lauder says, “ It isa favourite Scotch trec,
having been much planted about old aristocratic residencea in Scotland3 and,
if the doubt ol‘ its being a native of Britain be true, which, however, vve cau·
not believe, then it is probabis that the long intimacy which subsisted between
Franco and Scotland may be the cause of ita being so prevalent in the latter
country.” (Lauder’r Gilpin, i. p. 121. ln Switaerland, the tree is found
