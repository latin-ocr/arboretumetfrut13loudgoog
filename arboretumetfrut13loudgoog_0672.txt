Ala undernood, uie sycamore shoots freely from the stool to the age of 8⁰
or 100 years. Aa a timber tres, it ismostadvantageoualy cut down at the aga
of 80 years, or from that age to 100. ln German ,the tree which heom-
tuonly planted along with it, in plantations made witi a view to rolla, is the
bosch. As an ornamental tree, it produces the best affect; ei er singu, in
groups os two or three, placed suffiueutly near to form a whole, hut not so as
to touch each other ς and in rows or avenues. The varieties with variegatarl
leaves are very ornamental in the beginning of summan but their leaves are
almost always more or less imperfect, especially ou the edgos, aud fall off
much sooner in tha autumn than theseos t e species. The leaves of the pur·
ple variety are not liable to the satae objections as those of the variegmad
