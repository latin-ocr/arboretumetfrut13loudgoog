Sper. etur, dc. Leaves more or less heartshaped, roundish, 5-lobed‚ smooth
beneeth; the lobes generally obtuse, and coarsely serrated. Flowers
in drooping corymbs. Keys smooth. (Pen. Cyn.) A tree‚a native oi
Corsicar from which country it was brought to Paris by M. Richard, and
thence to England, in 1752. It is described by Baudillnrt as ο branchy
tnfted tree, covered with smooth leaves, somewhat coriaceous, roundish,
indented, with live blunt lobes, deep green on the up r sruiace, and some-
wbat glaucone underneath, with long red petiolas. iii flowers are whitish,
in short racemes; and the small fruita, or heys, which succeed them, are
almost round. lt found in foresta and on mountains in Corsica, and in
Italyr where, from the densenesa oi its abade, it is sometimes planted by
road sides, and in gainem near honses. The red colour of the petioles, oi'
the leaves, of the fruits, and even the red tinge os the leaves themselves,
more especially in autumn, give it rather a morbid ap nce. lt pushes
later in the spring than most oi the other species. he wood ia remed,
and very close: in itnly, it is used ior gun-stochs3 and the roots, especially
of those trees which have been osten cut down, are very uruch soughtaster
on account ol their hardness, and their curioua knots and blotches, which
render them auitable ior rnahing annffboxes, and ior inlaid worh.

Variety. A. eoridcesnn, in the arboretam of the Messrs. Loddiges, seems to
be a variety os this species; but A. opulilblinm, No. 14, as described by
Bandrillnrt, seems quite distinct from it.

Sper. Char, dc. Leaves cordate, ronndish, 5·lobed. Lobes obtuse, bluntly
andcoarselytoothed. Corymbs almost sessile. Ovaries endfruitsmooth,
with wings rather diverging. (Don’s Mill.,i. pets.) Accordin to Dr.
Lindley, m the Pea. Cyn, this kind is the same as A. O'palustitut, ac-
cording to Boudrillart, it is quite distinct. Its height, the latter says, is
from 20 ft. to esst. or eost. lt grows naturally in the French Alps, and
on the Pyrenees. Its barlr ingrey; its leaves bave niobes, somewhat
rounded, alittle toothed, and greener above than below. It flowers are

in droossing racemes; its fruits are swelled out, and their wings spreeding ς

so mue so as to form almost a straight line, like those os A. platanb'ides.

It is common on the rocks oi MountJura3and is considered preferable to all
