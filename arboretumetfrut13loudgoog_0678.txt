Hutoy. 'l'his tree was introduced by Sir charles Wager, in 1725, and
has since been in gener-al cultiiation. It wes at first supposed to be a variety
ol A.ri1bn1m; and, as such, is mentioned in Mertyn's Miller. ln the first
edition ol Du Hcmel, the two sensere described as distinct varieties; and
their specific distinctions were asterwards pointed out by Deslonteines, in the
Aac. du Mur. d‘Hirt. Nat. dc Paris, vol. vii. p.412.; the principel distinction
consisting in the imit ol Α. eriocarpuni being woolly, and that ol A. rubrum
being smooth. Both species are now iu very general cultivation, throughout
Europe, as ornamentnl trees.

the wood os this species, when that of the tulip tree cannot be procured
At Pittsburg, and iu the neighbouring towns, it is used, in cabinet-making,
instead ol holly, aud for inlaying furniture made of mahogany, cherry tree,
sud walnut; though it is not exnctly suitable for'tbis purpose, as it acon
changes colcur. 'l'lie hatters ot' Pittsburg prefer the charcoal of this wood
to every other for heating their bollers, as it nffords a more unisorm and du-
rableheat than any other. Sugaris made from this species in districts where
the trec abounds‚ but the produce ia not above hall that obtained from the sap
ol the sugnr maple. The sap is in motion very early inthis specics, beginning
to ascend about the l5th ol lanuary; so that, when sugat is mede from it, the
work of extracting it is sooner completed. The cellulas· integument rapidly
