= Description. Iu America, the red-flowering maple, Michaux observes, is
the earliest tree, the hloom of which announces the return of springy itis in
flower, near New Yorlr,from the lllth tothe 15818 81 April. The blossoms, which
are of abeautiful purplish or deep red, unfold more thuna fortnight before
the leaves. They are aggregate, and situated at the extremit 81 the branches.
'l'he fruit 18 suspended by long hexible peduncles, and is of the same hue with
the flowers; though it varies in aize and in the intensit of its colourin ,
according to the exposure and dampness of the soil. Thekeys and the sescla
are one alf smaller than those of A. eriooirpum, and they ripen sooner. The
leaves are also smaller than those of that species; but, in most other respecta,
they resemble them. They 888 glaucone and whitish underneath, and are
palmated, or divided into 388 4 acuminata lobes, irregularly toothed. The
extremities of this tree, which 888 formed by numerous twigs united at the
base, have a remarkable appearance when garnished with howers and seeds of
8 deep red, before vegetation has bag 8 generally to revive. Before the red-
llowering maple exceeds 25 lt. or 30 . 18 height, 8ηά 71888818. 18 diameter,
its bnrk is perfecti smooth, and marked with white blotches, by which it 18

(8818888888) aud sweet gum (Liquidr‘ambar Styraclllus), becomes brown
sud chapped. 18 this tres, 88 18 others which grow in wet places, the sap·
wood bears 8 large proportion to the beart-wood, if, indeed, the name of 188888-

first, scantily, about Malebaye, 18 Canada, iu 18ο north latitude; 188, ru pro-
ceeding southward, it soon becomes more common, and abounds in Florida
and Lower Louisiana. Os all the trees which flourish in grounds which are
occasionally overflowed, this species is most multiplied in the middle and
southern states. lt occupies, ru great art, the borders 81 the creeks, and
