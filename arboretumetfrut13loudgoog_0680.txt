that rt flowers about the middle of April, and that Su charles Wager's maple
llowers about the middle or latter end of March. ln blartyn‘s Miller, pub-
lished in 1807, the two are still consideredasthe mines ies. We harenc
doubt of their being in fact only varieties, or races, of ammes ies; but
we hate kept them distinct, as they are remarkably different, bo in tlre eo-
lour of their flowers, aud in their habit ofgrowth, tho not much so in tlrer'r
leaves. blichaux was the first to distinguish the two ' ds aa species,and tlte
distinction (as before observed, p. 424.) was first pointed outin detail by Des-
fontaines. Aa Α. tibrum is notar idly growing tree, like A. eriochrpum, it

considerable is the demand, that hocta laden with them frequently tirrise at
New York and Philadelpbia, where an extensive manufactory rs carried on for
thc consumption of the ne' hbouring towns, and for exportation to tlte south-
ern states and to the West igndia lalanda. The whole hamc ofjapnnned chairs
ia made of this wood, except the back, for which bichory (Carya) is chosen,
on account of its superior strength and elasticity. The fiante, the nave, and
the spolies of spinning·wbeels are made of thered maple. At Philadel bia,itia
exclusively used for saddle-trees5 and, in the country, it ispreferred or yohes,
choreis, and wooden dishes, which are brou ht to market by the country peo-
ple‚ and purchased by the dealers iu wo en ware. It sometimes happens
ticet, in very old trees, the grain, instead of following a perpendicular directior,
is nudulated ς and this variet bears the narne of the curled maple. This sin-
gular arrangement is never {hund in young trees, nor in the brauches of even
auch as exhibit it in the trunk: it is also less conspicuous in the centre than
near the circumferente. Trees having thir character of wood ure rare, and do
not exist in the proportion of oue to a hundred. The serpentine direction of
the libre, which rendere them difficult to split and to work, produces, in the
hands of a shilful mechanic‚ the most beautiful effecta of light arrd shade.
These effecta are rendered more striking, if, aster smoothing the suriace of tbe
wood with a double-ironed plane, it is rubbed with a little sulphuris aeid, and
afterwards ancinted with linaeed oil. On examining it attentively‚ the varying
chades are found to he owing entirely to the inflection os the ruys of light3
which is more sensibly perceived in viewin it in different directions hy candle·
light. Before mahogany became generally fashionable in the United States,
thebeat furniture in use was made of the red-floweriug maple, and bedsteads
are still made of it, which,in ricbness and lustre, exceed the finest mahogany.
