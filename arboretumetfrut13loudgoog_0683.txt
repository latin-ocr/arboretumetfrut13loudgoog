the London Horticultural Society, and, not far from it, a round·
headed sbrubby tree of the original species. Α subvariety of this
sort, with variegated leaves, is propagated in the Bollwyller Nursery.

Descr'ption. Α. c. hebectrpum is the British form of this species3 and itis
thus characterised by Smitb in bis Eng. Floro, ii. . 231. A rather small tree,
with spreading branches3 the berk corhy, and lull of tamem that of the
branchessmooth. Leaves about liin. wide, downy while young,asare their κ
footstalks, obtusely 5·lobed, here and there notched, sometimes quite entire.
Flowers green, in clusters that terminate the young sboots, bairy, erect, short,
and somewhat corymbose. Anthers hairy between the lobes. Capsules
downy, spreadiug horizontelly, with smooth, oblong, reddislr wings. The cha-
racter of the flowera,in being produced upon the young shoots, ascribed to the
Brittah field maple by Smith, is one which it possesses, and one in which it
differs markedly from certain exotickinds3 as Α. eriochrpnm, Α. rubrum, and
d. monspessulbnum3 the flowers of which species are roduced from buda dis-
tinct from those outof which the shoots are develop . ln Britain, it seldom
attarns the height of more than 20 fl„ except in a state of cultivation.

Geogruplty. This species is found throughout the middle states of Europe,
and in the north of Asta. According to Pallas, it is found in Now Russia, and
about Caucasus. In Britain, it is common in betlges and thickets, in the mid·
dle and south of England ; but is rare in the northern counties and in Scote
land. It is not a native of Ireland, and, perhaps, not of Scotland.

and flexible, are employed by the coachmen, in some parts of Fronte, instead
of whips. The trecis much used iu France for forming hed es, and for filling
