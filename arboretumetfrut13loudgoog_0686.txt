dstion might be effected in this genus, as well ss it is in various others. The
objecta ought to be, to get more colour into the flowers,and more red into
the leaves. A. monspessulinurn, with flowers es red as those ot' A. rubrum,
would be e fine variety. Possibly some of the species might he fecundeted
ο some species os the genus Negrana, which would leod to great changes in
cie leaves. As e number of the species of A'cer do not flower sud perfect
seeds, till they become considerable trees, it would be desirahle, when experi-
ments erc to be mede by moselecundetion, and the person wishin to try
these experimentis only young trees, to them wi scions
from trees which y llower end fruit. ln co ecting species sor this
purpose, cere most be tehen, either to procure lente producing hermaphro-
dite flowers. or plante having mele and fem e tlowers on the seme tren
unless, indeed, advantage is proposed to be tehen of the circumstance ol the
tree being only of one sex, to fecundare its flowers, if ferme, or pistilliserous,
with the mele tlowers os another species3 or, is staminil'erous, to fecundste
with them the female llowers of some other kind We ere strongly inclined
to believe that some ol what ere now considered aboriginal species ol' A'cer
ere only the result of eroes-fecundation, produced ογ accident ς and hence we
enti ' te a number oi new forms, when the attention oi cultiretoss is power·
