most abundant ; and, instead of being conlined, asin the upper parts of Vir-

grocmt (Roblnr'a), wild cherry (Gerasus virginihm), and coffae tres (Gymno-
clsdus). But in the bottoms which akirt the rrvers, where the soil is deep,

but Michaux denies this to be the case. He su sts that, from its rapid
growth,aller being cut down to the ound, it might orm avaluableunderwood,
to be cut every 3 or ι years, for fue , charmel, or other purpoaes. It has been
tried in this way in France; but, unless the soil be kept constautly humid, the
rtool is found to decsy in a ver few years. Baudillart considers it the least
useful of all the tree maples. lhEnglnnd, it is aolely to be considered aa an
ornamental tree3 and, as wa have before observcd, rt is one of considerable
show3 and, being also one of rapid growth, it well merite the attention of
plectens, in situations where immediate effectis an object.

Sall, Βίιοοιίοη, dc. The same soil and situation which suit the Alcer will
answer for the Negtndo. The plsntgrowa with amazing rapidity, when the
soil is deep and somewhat moist; but, as it ie not a long-lived trec, it should
not be laced in situations where the nnanent effect of wood is of import-
ance. hen raised from seed, it shouldealways, if possible, be aown in the
autumn, as soon as practicable after gotharing, as it keeps with difficulty till
the spring, even when mixed with sand.
