Description. All the species proept one, which is a shrub) are deciduous
trees,vvith deeply cut leaves, anda o llowerarandtheyare distinguished from
the genus Privrn hythe rougbness of t eir fruit, and by the comparative rough·
ness, also, of their leaves. To us it appears doubtful if the rou hnass of the
fruit be a sufficiant generis distinction, since it varies much in inferent indi·
viduale, and since, in some of the sorta, which have apparently beenoriginated
between AE‘sculus and Pana, the furit is as smooth, or nearly ss much ao,as in
the proper pavias. Itis highly probable that the two genera consist, in fact,
of only two, or at nrost three, distincta 'esc however, all the different sorta r
in cultivation are so truly ornamen ‚that they may very conveniently be
kept distinct, aa races or botanical species. The common horsechestnutis
invariabl propagated hythe nuta, which are sown when newly gethered, or
in the foilowi spring3 and in either case tbey will corne up the succeeding
summer. All t e other sorts, aa being varieties of the species, are propagated

by budding or gralting.

teresting and beautiful when they are first cieveloped. When enfolded in the
bud, they ere covered with pubescence, which fala off aa the leaves become
expanded, sooner or later, according to the dryness or moistness of the
aeason. The growth, both of the tree and of the leaves, is ver rspid3 both
shoots and leaves being sometimes perfected in three weelrs rom tlre time
of foliation; in which time, says Miller, l have measured ahoota ll fi. long,
with their leaves fully expanded. The llowers ep ear a short time aller the
leaves, and are white, variegated with red and yeliow: they expand in May,
and the fruit ripens about the end of Se tember or the beginning of October.

downy interior from the wet. Misa ent observes that “we cannot have
a better specimen of the early formation of planta in the hod, than in that of
the horsechcstnot.” Α celebrated German naturallst ‹letached from this trec,
in the winter season, a flower bud not larger than a pes, and first took off the
extemal coveri which he found consisted of seventeen scales. Hsvin re-

of which were so distinctly visible, that, with the aid of a microscope, he not
only counted 68 flowers, but could discern the pollen of the statuens, and
