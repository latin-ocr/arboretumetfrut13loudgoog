Geography,Hiatory,dc.. The rue may be found ina 'r

wild state in the south ol France, in Spain, and in the 7 ·, ζ

north ol Italy. We have pathered it, growing along with . ’ἶ

Psorrilea bitumindse, on t e rocks about Nice, and along *1
the coast naar Genea. The rue was first recorded by ἵ
Turner in 15623 but, l'rom its' reputed medicinal qualr-

ties, and its nse in religious ceremonies, it was probably introduced into Eng-

land by the monica, many centuries before.

Properties arrd Uter. “The rue end itaallies,’‘ Professor Burnet observes,

‘⁴ are bitter stimulating planta, with astron but rather unplcasant smell, and

a hotbittertaste. 12. graveolens is, inde ,so acrid, that the bruised leaves

will excoriate the lips and nostrils, and inflame the sitin, if applied as acata-

plasm. Rue was much esteemedinancient medicinetHippocrates commenda
it: lor many eges it was considered a preventive of contagioni, and called the
herb ol grace ς and, in later times, Boerhaave observes that the greatest com·
mendatione he can bestow upon it fall short of its merita. ‘What medicine,’
says be, ‘can be ruore efficacious for promoting perspiration for the cure of
hysteric passion, and ol epilepsies, and for expelling poison l’ Bnt, notwith-
standing all these praises, which are tmly questionable, rue is now seldom
employed, except in the form of tea, by village doctresses.” (Barnet’t

Ordliaea ty* Botang, vol. 2. p. 882.) Notwithstanding these observatione of

Professor Burnet, the me icinal properties of the rue have been spoken of
in terma of respect by Lewis, Woodvrlle, Thomson, and other authors; and
the following is a summary ol their observatione. The internal nse ol the rue
is ansele in large quantillus, bnt caten with breed and butter, as it very com·
monly isin Franoe and Germany,a considerable dose may be taken without
injury. In Britain, it is pren to children es a vermisnge; and, mixed with
butter, to poultry, aa a remedy for the ronp, &a lt is also given to dags
as a cure sor the distemper, end is considered by the country peoplc generally
asan excellent “cleanser ol the blood.'’ By distillation wit water, an
essential oil is obtained srorn it; and by inhrsion in alcobol, a tinctura which
is warm, pungent, acrid, and penetrating. A conserve, made by hasting the
fresh leaves with fine angar, is the most comtnodious form for using tho herb in
substance: the extract is given in doses of from 10 to 15 grains. To labouring
men, if used with discretion, it might prove a condirnent to their laod, in
the sarpthway aa gatlia does in France, Spain, and ltaly, and onions in most
