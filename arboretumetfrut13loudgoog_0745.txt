Geograplsp, Iliam, de. This species‘of Attum is a· native of the northern
provinces ol China, mere particularly in the neighbourhood of Pekin. Seeds

sesne year. Aa the tree produced suckers freel ‚rt was soon generally pro·
pagated5 and there are many line specimens oi it iu different parts ol the
country. The original tree planted hy Mr. Webb was cut down some years
ago ς but several others, which hare sprung up from the root's left in the soil,
were io existence about the saure spot when we visited it in 1834. (See
θανά. Mag, vol. ix. peel.) The trec was introduced into Frauce, in 1780, ,
by Mr.Bla1lrie,uand the oldest specimens are at St. Len, aud in the Jerdin des
Plantes. We¹ have not heard of the timber having been applied to any useful
purpose in Europe, because trees ¹os a large size are not yet sufficieotly nu·
merous to admit of their being cut down for profitable application. In France
and Italy, it is much ralued as a trce for shading public wnllrs, andis lanted
for that purpose along with the tulip trec, the horsechestnut, the piistanus,
and other large-leaved exotic trees. Its leaves are not liable to bc attaclred
by insccts, which is a very great recommendation, and they continue on the
trec, and retain their green colour, till the first hosts in November; when the
leaflets drop suddenly off, the petioles remaining on often a week or two
longer. The tree grows in any soil, though one that is light and somewhat
humid, and a sheltered situation, suit it best. ln France, it is said to thrive
on challry soils, and attain a large elsewhere scarcely any other¹ tree will
